# Society Structure in the Histologic World - Full Documentation

## Overview

Society in the histologic era is fundamentally organized around the principle of shared historical truth. Traditional markers of identity—language, ethnicity, religion, culture—have been subordinated to a single defining characteristic: which version of history you believe. This has created a world where ideological unity is absolute within nations but conflicts between nations are irreconcilable, as each possesses its own "truth" backed by their factorepo.

## Histonation Structure

### Formation and Identity

**How Histonations Form**

1. **Original Formation** [TO BE DEVELOPED]
   - Transition from old nations to histonations
   - How were initial factorepos created?
   - What happened to multi-cultural states?
   - How were borders redrawn?

2. **Histobranching**
   - Occurs when significant portion disputes specific facts
   - Requires critical mass (minimum percentage/number)
   - Dissidents must organize and declare independence
   - New factorepo created by branching from parent
   - Disputed facts altered or removed in new version
   - Must establish territory (histocircle)

3. **Merger** [Rare]
   - Two histonations discover compatible factorepos
   - Requires complete logical consistency check
   - Usually only possible with very small nations
   - Creates unified factorepo and territory
   - Celebrated as ideal but rarely achieved

**Histonation Characteristics**

- **Size**: From thousands to billions of people
- **Territory**: Contiguous histocircle (usually) or scattered enclaves
- **Government**: Varies, but all subordinate to factorepo truth
- **Identity**: Defined entirely by shared historical belief
- **Stability**: Depends on factorepo consistency and citizen belief

### Governance Models

**The Judge as Foundation**
- All governments operate under The Judge's authority
- Legal disputes resolved by factual determination
- No appeals or interpretation—facts are absolute
- Government decisions become facts in factorepo
- Leaders constrained by historical record

**Possible Government Types** [TO BE DEVELOPED]

1. **Technocracy**
   - Rule by factorepo administrators and Judge operators
   - Decisions based on logical optimization
   - Minimal human political process

2. **Democratic Histonation**
   - Citizens vote on policies (which become facts)
   - Debate within framework of accepted history
   - Majority decisions added to factorepo
   - Dissent limited to future policy, not past truth

3. **Authoritarian Histonation**
   - Elite control factorepo additions
   - Strict correction of doubters
   - Heavy surveillance and enforcement
   - Stability through fear and conditioning

4. **Theocratic Histonation**
   - Religious interpretation of factorepo
   - Historical facts given spiritual significance
   - Priests as factorepo interpreters
   - Correction as religious conversion

5. **Corporate Histonation**
   - Business interests control government
   - Economic facts prioritized in factorepo
   - Citizens as employees/shareholders
   - Profit motive drives policy

### Territory and Borders

**Histocircle Definition**
- Geographic area controlled by histonation
- Defined by precise coordinates in factorepo
- Border facts must be consistent with neighbor's factorepo (or disputed)
- Can be non-contiguous if historically justified

**Border Types**

1. **Agreed Borders**
   - Both nations' factorepos contain same boundary facts
   - Peaceful crossing possible
   - Trade and diplomacy function normally
   - Rare and valuable

2. **Disputed Borders**
   - Factorepos contain contradictory boundary claims
   - Both nations believe they control same territory
   - Constant tension and skirmishes
   - Most common border type
   - International Judge cannot resolve (contradictory facts)

3. **Neutral Zones**
   - Areas claimed by no histonation
   - Or claimed by all (contradiction)
   - Lawless regions outside factorepo system
   - Haven for outlaws and refugees
   - Dangerous but free

4. **Occupied Territories**
   - Recently conquered regions
   - Population undergoing factorepo transition
   - Heavy military presence
   - Resistance and correction ongoing
   - Unstable and violent

## International Relations

### Diplomacy Between Incompatible Truths

**Challenges**

- Compromise requires changing history
- Trust impossible with different truths

**Mechanisms**
- International Judges (limited authority)

- Often limited to simple exchanges
- Complex deals nearly impossible
- Economic isolation common

## Story Potential

### Social Tensions

1. **Authority vs. Individual**: Who controls truth?
2. **Stability vs. Freedom**: Perfect order or chaotic liberty?
3. **Belief vs. Knowledge**: Can forced belief be real?
4. **Unity vs. Diversity**: Homogeneity or pluralism?
5. **Past vs. Future**: Obsession with history prevents progress?

### Character Archetypes

**The Believer**: Absolute faith in factorepo, enforces truth
**The Doubter**: Questions begin, must hide or flee
**The Corrector**: Enforces belief, questions own role
**The Outlaw**: Lives free but hunted
**The Infiltrator**: Pretends belief, works to undermine
**The Administrator**: Power over truth, tempted by corruption
**The Innocent**: Child growing up in system, gradual awareness

### Conflict Scenarios

1. Lovers from incompatible histonations
2. Corrector falls for outlaw
3. Administrator discovers system-wide contradiction
4. Child who cannot be made to believe
5. Historian forced to falsify facts
6. Outlaw community discovered and besieged
7. Two histonations on brink of merger
8. Judge begins making inexplicable decisions
