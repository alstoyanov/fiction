# The Histologic System - Concise Reference

## Core Concept
History has become an exact science. All historical facts are stored in factorepos, verified for logical consistency, and used as the foundation for truth, law, and governance. Nations are defined by shared belief in a specific version of history, not by language, ethnicity, or geography.

## Key Components

### Factorepo
- Database storing all historical facts
- Primary repo: globally important events
- Local repos: personal and regional facts
- All facts verified for contradictions
- Contains: time, location, involved parties, event description
- Every citizen's life is completely recorded

### The Judge
- Supercomputer that accesses factorepo
- Resolves all legal disputes through logical deduction
- Cannot be appealed (facts are absolute)
- Each histonation has its own Judge
- International Judges exist but have limited power

### Universal Language
- Single language with direct machine translation
- Eliminates ambiguity and interpretation
- Enables automated fact verification
- Spoken by all humanity

### Histonation
- Group of people sharing the same history (factorepo)
- Occupies a territory called a histocircle
- Citizens do not question their nation's truth
- Doubt is considered criminal or mental illness

### Histofact
- Individual historical fact in the factorepo
- Must contain: precise time, location, involved parties
- Checked against all other facts for contradictions
- Can be added by authorized officials, sensors, or The Judge

## Social Structure

**Truth and Belief**
- Citizens absolutely believe their histonation's factorepo
- Questioning truth makes you an outlaw
- Options: corrective facility or exile from histocircle
- No privacy—all actions recorded in factorepo

**Outlaws**
- People who doubt their nation's history
- Must undergo correction or leave territory
- Cannot remain while questioning truth

**Corrective Facilities**
- Institutions that "correct" doubters
- Make people believe in the nation's history
- Alternative to exile

## Conflict Types

**Histobranch Conflicts** (Most Common)
- Significant group disputes certain facts
- Forms new histonation with branched factorepo
- Must claim territory from parent nation
- Leads to war over land and truth
- Most common type of military conflict

**Resource Conflicts** (Less Common)
- War over physical resources
- High casualties, rarely clear winners
- Winner forces their factorepo on loser
- Conquered must accept new history or become outlaws

**Conquest by Division** (Strategic)
- Introduce false facts to split enemy histonation
- Causes internal fighting and military fracturing
- Weakens enemy for easier conquest
- Long-term covert operation

## Key Tensions

1. **Perfect record eliminates privacy and freedom**
2. **Shared truth creates unity but eliminates alternatives**
3. **Multiple "truths" exist—one per histonation**
4. **System prevents uncertainty but also change**
5. **Past obsession vs. future progress**
6. **Individual freedom vs. collective truth**

## Story Potential

**Character Types**
- The Doubter (questions their truth)
- The Corrector (enforces belief)
- The Judge Operator (maintains the system)
- The Historian (adds facts to factorepo)
- The Outlaw (lives outside the system)
- The Conqueror (expands histonation)

**Plot Hooks**
- Fundamental contradiction discovered in factorepo
- Conspiracy to falsify historical facts
- Person who exists in no factorepo
- Technology to alter factorepo undetected
- Region where the system has failed
- Two compatible histonations discover common ground

## Critical Questions

- Is there objective truth beyond all factorepos?
- What happens when The Judge malfunctions?
- How do people maintain humanity without privacy?
- Can this system be overthrown or reformed?
- What was lost when history became exact science?
