## 🔑 Key Questions Answered

### About Neural Interfaces

**Q: How are people convinced to get neural interfaces?**
A: Gradually. Started as "voluntary" solution to information warfare (2050s), promised perfect memory and instant knowledge, became mandatory through social pressure and legal requirements (2061-2065). See `neural-interface-society.md` Section 1.

**Q: How does installation happen?**
A: Minimally invasive neurosurgery at age 7-12. Bio-integrated mesh inserted via catheter, self-assembles in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Takes 3-4 hours, recovery 1-2 weeks. See `neural-interface-society.md` Section 2.

**Q: Are there people without interfaces?**
A: Yes, but rare in Histologic nations:
- Non-Histologic citizens (2 billion in SFW/CNT)
- Refuseniks (<0.1%, marginalized)
- Medical exemptions (<0.01%, monitored)
- Resistance post-removal (~500, hunted)
See `neural-interface-society.md` Section 3.

**Q: Has anyone successfully removed one?**
A: Partial removal only. Full removal is fatal. Dr. Yuki Tanaka can disable receiver nodes and remove tracking components (5-10% mortality rate). ~500 successful cases. See `neural-interface-society.md` Section 4.

### About Fact Storms

**Q: How do fact storms actually work?**
A: Neural interfaces receive contradictory broadcasts from competing towers. Brain tries to hold incompatible memories simultaneously. Causes perceptual breakdown and neural damage. See `FACT-STORMS-TECHNICAL-MECHANISM.md` or `fact-storms-full.md`.

**Q: Why do buildings appear to flicker?**
A: They don't actually flicker—it's perceptual illusion. Your brain receives contradictory information about what you're seeing and rapidly switches between interpretations. See `fact-storms-full.md` Section on Physical Manifestation.

**Q: How do protection methods work?**
A: By providing neural pathways that bypass the compromised interface:
- Music: Different brain regions, occupies cognitive resources
- Touch: Bypasses interface entirely
- Memory: Organic pathways, no interface involvement
See `fact-storms-full.md` Section on Protection.

### About Border Zones

**Q: Why do nations receive facts from other nations?**
A: Tower ranges overlap at borders (physics limitation). Quantum broadcasts can't be geographically blocked. Neural interfaces receive ALL broadcasts in range. Could be solved but deliberately isn't—border conflicts serve Architects' control purposes. See `neural-interface-society.md` Section 5.

**Q: Why not just turn off border towers?**
A: Would create "dead zones" where citizens can't function. Economically and socially unviable. The Architects maintain overlapping broadcasts deliberately to create perpetual conflict. See `neural-interface-society.md` Section 5.

### About Non-Histologic Nations

**Q: What about people in non-Histologic countries?**
A: 
- **SFW**: Refuse interfaces, accept information chaos as price of freedom (~800 million)
- **CNT**: Use different control system, no neural interfaces (~1.2 billion)
- **Unaligned**: No system, pre-Histologic methods (~200 million)
See `neural-interface-society.md` Section 6.

## 📊 Key Statistics

### Global Population (2106)
- **Total**: ~5.2 billion
- **With neural interfaces**: ~3 billion (Histologic nations)
- **With other control systems**: ~1.2 billion (CNT)
- **Without control systems**: ~2 billion (SFW + unaligned)

### Interface Coverage
- **Histologic nations**: 99.9% have interfaces
- **Refuseniks**: <0.1% (marginalized)
- **Medical exemptions**: <0.01% (monitored)
- **Resistance post-removal**: ~500 people (hunted)

### Fact Storm Exposure
- **Safe exposure**: < 5 minutes
- **Dangerous exposure**: > 15 minutes
- **Chronic exposure**: Any repeated exposure
- **Mortality**: ~10% in severe exposure, 100% eventual in chronic

### Interface Removal
- **Full removal**: 100% fatal
- **Partial disabling**: 5-10% mortality, 20% severe complications
- **Successful removals**: ~500 total (Dr. Tanaka and others)
- **Practitioners**: <10 doctors worldwide

## 🎭 Thematic Core

**Fact storms represent**:
- Truth as tyranny
- Reality as construct
- Solidarity as survival
- System as violence
- Technology as control

**Neural interfaces represent**:
- Sold as liberation, actually enslavement
- Installed in childhood (can't consent)
- Impossible to fully remove (trapped)
- Perfect totalitarian tool
- "Freedom through truth" becomes "control through certainty"

**The horror**:
- Your own brain attacks you
- Can't trust your perception
- Can't escape the system
- Removal means death or exile
- By the time you realize, it's too late

**The hope**:
- Human connection bypasses technology
- Music, touch, memory provide anchors
- "You'll never walk alone"
- Together we endure what alone would destroy us
- Resistance is possible, difficult, but real

## ✍️ Writing Guidelines

### When Writing Fact Storms

**Do**:
- Emphasize perceptual breakdown
- Show physical pain and disorientation
- Include shared experience (everyone affected)
- Show collateral damage to civilians
- Use protection methods (music, touch, memory)
- Reference neural interfaces receiving contradictory broadcasts

**Don't**:
- Suggest reality actually changes
- Make it too abstract or metaphorical
- Forget the physical component
- Ignore collateral damage
- Make protection too easy
- Forget that it's technology, not magic

### Character Knowledge Levels

**Experts** (can explain mechanism):
- Dr. Yuki Tanaka (medical)
- Kira Osman (technical)
- Elena Volkov (weaponization)
- Alexei Volkov (conspiracy)
- Nikolai Volkov (systems)

**Experienced** (know from exposure):
- Dmitri Volkov (border duty)
- Mikhail Petrov (protection methods)
- Border zone residents

**Learning** (discovering):
- Marcus Chen
- Isaiah Okonkwo
- Most citizens (don't know how it works)

### Consistency Checks

- ✅ Neural interfaces mentioned
- ✅ Broadcast towers exist
- ✅ Border zones are high-risk
- ✅ Protection methods used
- ✅ Collateral damage acknowledged
- ✅ Perceptual illusion, not actual change
- ✅ Character knowledge appropriate
