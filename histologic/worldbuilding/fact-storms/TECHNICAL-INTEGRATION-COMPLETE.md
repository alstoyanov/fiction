## What Was Added

### Technical Concepts Explained

✅ **Neural Interfaces**:
- Bio-integrated mesh in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex
- Receives quantum broadcasts from towers
- Integrates facts into memory formation
- Makes factorepo information feel "real"
- Installed at young age (varies by nation)
- Removal causes death—"trapped in system"

✅ **Broadcast System**:
- Quantum-entangled towers throughout nations
- Continuous transmission of location-relevant facts
- Overlapping coverage in border zones
- Can't be blocked by traditional means

✅ **How Fact Storms Work**:
- Contradictory broadcasts from competing towers
- Neural interface receives both simultaneously
- Brain can't reconcile incompatible memories
- Hippocampus stressed, unable to form coherent memory
- Perceptual breakdown (buildings "flicker")
- Physical damage: white matter lesions, neural death

✅ **Why Reality Appears to Change**:
- Not actual reality change—perceptual illusion
- Brain receives: eyes + interface (version 1) + interface (version 2)
- Visual cortex can't reconcile, rapidly switches
- Shared hallucination (everyone receives same broadcasts)
- Feels completely real but is perception failing

✅ **How Protection Works**:
- **Music/Song**: Different neural pathways, occupies cognitive resources
- **Touch**: Bypasses interface entirely, prioritizes physical sensation
- **Memory**: Personal memories in organic pathways, no interface
- **Training**: Alternative response patterns, reduces panic

✅ **Weaponization**:
- Inject contradictory facts into competing factorepos
- Synchronize broadcasts for simultaneous transmission
- Control radius, duration, intensity
- Accept collateral damage to civilians
- Used for psychological warfare, assassinations, cover operations
