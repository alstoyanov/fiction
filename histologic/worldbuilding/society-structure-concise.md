# Society Structure - Concise Reference

## Core Principle
Society organized around shared historical truth. Identity defined by which factorepo you believe, not by language, ethnicity, or culture.

## Histonation Structure

**Formation**
- Histobranching: significant group disputes facts, splits off, claims territory
- Merger: rare, requires completely compatible factorepos
- Original formation: transition from old nations [details TBD]

**Characteristics**
- Size: thousands to billions
- Territory: histocircle (defined by coordinates)
- Government: varies, but subordinate to The Judge
- Identity: shared historical belief only

**Border Types**
- Agreed: both factorepos match (rare, peaceful)
- Disputed: contradictory claims (common, tense)
- Neutral zones: unclaimed or multiply-claimed (lawless)
- Occupied: recently conquered (unstable)

## Social Hierarchy

**Factorepo Administrators**: Add facts to primary repo, highest authority
**Judge Operators**: Maintain The Judge, technical experts
**Historians**: Add specialized facts, gatekeepers of truth
**Correctors**: Make doubters believe again, work in facilities
**Enforcers**: Police/military, detect outlaws, protect system
**Citizens**: Ordinary people, completely surveilled, must believe
**Outlaws**: Outside system, no protections, hunted

## Daily Life

**Surveillance**
- Everything recorded: location, communications, transactions, interactions
- Benefits: perfect alibis, no unsolved crimes, contract enforcement
- Costs: no privacy, all mistakes permanent, dissent detected immediately

**Life Cycle**
- Birth: recorded with precise details, assigned ID
- Childhood: monitored, educated to believe, conditioned
- Adulthood: all activities logged, freedom within constraints
- Death: complete life history preserved forever

**Relationships**
- All documented in factorepo
- No secret affairs or hidden connections
- Romance under surveillance
- Marriage as permanent fact

## Outlaws and Resistance

**Becoming Outlaw**
- Question factorepo → detected → choice: correction or exile
- Triggers: doubt, discovering contradictions, exposure to other truths

**Corrective Facilities**
- Restore belief through conditioning, education, possibly drugs/tech
- Success rate [TBD]
- Alternative to exile
- Moral questions: Is forced belief ethical?

**Outlaw Communities**
- Neutral zones: lawless havens outside histonation control
- Underground networks: hidden within nations, help doubters escape
- Exile colonies: organized settlements, vulnerable to conquest

## International Relations

**Diplomacy Challenges**
- Incompatible factorepos make trust impossible
- Historical grievances are "facts" (cannot compromise)
- International Judges have limited authority
- Temporary agreements not binding (not facts)

**Trade**
- Requires compatible facts between nations
- Often limited to simple exchanges
- Neutral zone trade: risky but outside system
- Economic isolation common

**War**
- Causes: territorial disputes, resources, histobranching, ideology
- Outcome: winner forces factorepo on loser
- Conquered must accept new history or become outlaws

## Key Tensions

1. **Authority vs. Individual**: Who controls truth?
2. **Stability vs. Freedom**: Perfect order vs. liberty
3. **Belief vs. Knowledge**: Can forced belief be real?
4. **Unity vs. Diversity**: Homogeneity vs. pluralism
5. **Past vs. Future**: History obsession prevents progress

## Character Types

- **The Believer**: Absolute faith, enforces truth
- **The Doubter**: Questions begin, must hide
- **The Corrector**: Enforces belief, questions role
- **The Outlaw**: Free but hunted
- **The Infiltrator**: Pretends belief, undermines system
- **The Administrator**: Power over truth, corruption temptation

## Story Hooks

- Lovers from incompatible histonations
- Corrector falls for outlaw
- Administrator discovers system-wide contradiction
- Child who cannot be made to believe
- Historian forced to falsify facts
- Outlaw community discovered
- Judge makes inexplicable decisions
- Technology that erases facts
