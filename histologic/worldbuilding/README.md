## 📝 Key Concepts

### The Histologic System
A society where history is stored in a centralized database (factorepo) and enforced as absolute truth. An AI called The Judge determines truth and punishes "ideological contamination."

### Fact Storms
Catastrophic events where contradictory facts from competing factorepos overlap, causing reality instability and cognitive damage. Weaponized by governments for psychological warfare.

### Histologic Nations
- **Veridica** (USA-based) - Rigid, brass aesthetic, strict enforcement
- **Chronos** (Europe-based) - Temporal focus, gear aesthetic, competing with Veridica
- **Memoria** (Asia-based) - Memory-focused, jade aesthetic
- **Veritas** (South America-based) - Truth-seeking, copper aesthetic
- **Factum** (Africa-based) - Fact-recording, iron aesthetic

### Non-Histologic Nations
- **SFW** (Sovereign Free World) - Anarcho-libertarian, resists Histologic control
- **CNT** (Collective Nation of Tomorrow) - Authoritarian collective, rejects Histologic systems

### The Architects
Secret group of 12 who created the Histologic system to control humanity through manufactured conflict. Revealed in final novel "Architects of Chaos."

## 🎨 Aesthetic Notes

### Visual Style
- **Brass-punk**: Victorian-era technology with brass, copper, steam
- **Mechanical**: Gears, clockwork, pressure gauges
- **Gothic**: Dark, ornate, oppressive architecture
- **Steampunk**: Retrofuturistic, industrial revolution aesthetic

### Atmosphere
- **Oppressive**: Constant surveillance, truth enforcement
- **Uncertain**: Reality itself can become unstable
- **Foggy**: Border zones perpetually fog-shrouded
- **Mechanical**: Everything has gears, steam, brass fixtures
