### Grief
"Show me the fact that captures grief. Show me the data that explains loss. The old songs knew how to mourn. We've forgotten."

"Histologic tried to make everything certain. But the best things in life are uncertain: love, hope, beauty, meaning. The old songs knew this. We forgot."

### On Systems
"I've seen systems rise and fall. Monarchy, democracy, communism, capitalism, now Histologic. They all promise certainty. They all fail. Because humans aren't meant to be certain. We're meant to question, to seek, to wonder."

### On The Judge
"They built a machine to know everything. But wisdom isn't knowing everything. It's knowing what matters. The old songs knew what matters."
