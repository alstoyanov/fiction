## Using the Prompts

### For Midjourney
1. Copy entire prompt including technical parameters
2. Use `--ar 16:9` for landscape, `--ar 2:3` for portrait
3. Use `--style raw` for more detailed mechanical elements
4. Add `--chaos 20-30` for more creative interpretations
5. Current version: `--v 6` (adjust as needed)

### For DALL-E / Stable Diffusion
1. Remove Midjourney-specific parameters (`--ar`, `--style`, `--v`)
2. Keep descriptive text
3. Add "steampunk, Victorian era, brass and copper, highly detailed, 8k"
4. May need to emphasize "visible gears" and "mechanical details"

### For Other AI Generators
1. Focus on descriptive elements
2. Emphasize "steampunk aesthetic"
3. Specify "brass, copper, Victorian era"
4. Add "gaslight, steam, fog" for atmosphere

## Prompt Structure

Each prompt follows this structure:

```
[Style description] scene of [subject] [doing action]. 
[Key visual elements with materials]. 
[Lighting description]. 
[Atmospheric elements]. 
[Mood and composition notes]. 
[Technical parameters for Midjourney]
```

### Example:
```
Steampunk fantasy scene of a young Asian man in Victorian-era 
clothing with brass goggles, operating an enormous brass and 
copper factorepo machine. Massive mechanical apparatus with 
spinning gears, rotating data cylinders, and steam vents. 
Warm gaslight illumination. Hundreds of small brass tubes 
pneumatically transporting fact-capsules. Rich detail on 
brass fixtures and copper piping. 16:9 cinematic composition. 
--ar 16:9 --style raw --v 6
```
