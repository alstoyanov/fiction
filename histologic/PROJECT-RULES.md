## Document Versioning System

### Dual-Version Approach
Every major document MUST have two versions:

1. **Full Version** (`filename-full.md`)
   - Complete, detailed information
   - All nuances, examples, and explanations
   - Used for deep dives and detailed writing

2. **Concise Version** (`filename-concise.md`)
   - Maximum 500 words or 1-2 pages
   - Key points only
   - Used for context building and consistency checks
   - Updated whenever full version changes significantly

### Naming Conventions

- Full documents: `topic-full.md`
- Concise documents: `topic-concise.md`
- Character files: `character-name-full.md` / `character-name-concise.md`
- Plot files: `plot-title-full.md` / `plot-title-concise.md`
- Novel chapters: `novel-name/chapter-XX.md`

## Content Rules

### Consistency Requirements

1. **Always check concise versions first** when building context for new content
2. **Cross-reference** all new facts against existing worldbuilding documents
3. **Update both versions** when making significant changes
4. **Maintain a changelog** in each full document
5. **Use consistent terminology** as defined in the reference glossary

### Worldbuilding Principles

1. **Logical Consistency**: All facts must be internally consistent
2. **Scientific Plausibility**: Technology and systems should be theoretically possible
3. **Social Realism**: Human behavior and society should feel authentic
4. **Conflict Potential**: Every system should have inherent tensions for storytelling
5. **Scalability**: Concepts should work at personal, local, and global levels

### Writing Process

1. **Start with concise versions** to outline ideas
2. **Expand to full versions** with details and examples
3. **Review for contradictions** against existing material
4. **Update reference materials** with new terminology or concepts
5. **Create plot hooks** from worldbuilding elements

## Document Templates

### Required Sections for Worldbuilding Documents

- **Overview** (1-2 paragraphs)
- **Key Concepts** (bullet points)
- **Detailed Explanation** (full version only)
- **Implications** (how it affects the world)
- **Story Potential** (conflict, drama, character challenges)
- **Related Concepts** (links to other documents)
- **Changelog** (track major updates)

### Required Sections for Character Documents

- **Basic Info** (name, age, histonation, role)
- **Background** (concise history)
- **Beliefs** (relationship to their histonation's truth)
- **Conflicts** (internal and external)
- **Arc** (character development path)
- **Relationships** (connections to other characters)

### Required Sections for Plot Documents

- **Premise** (one-sentence hook)
- **Setting** (time, location, histonation)
- **Main Characters** (protagonist, antagonist, supporting)
- **Conflict** (core tension)
- **Structure** (act breakdown)
- **Themes** (what the story explores)
- **Resolution** (how it ends)

## Context Management Strategy

### For AI Assistance Sessions

1. **Always load concise versions** of all relevant worldbuilding docs
2. **Load full versions** only for the specific area being worked on
3. **Use reference glossary** for quick terminology checks
4. **Maintain session notes** for continuity between sessions

### Priority Loading Order

1. Core concepts (histologic, factorepo, histonation)
2. Relevant society/technology docs
3. Character concise versions
4. Plot outline for current work
5. Full versions as needed

## Quality Control

### Before Adding New Content

- [ ] Does it contradict existing facts?
- [ ] Is it consistent with the technology level?
- [ ] Does it fit the social structure?
- [ ] Does it create interesting story potential?
- [ ] Have both versions been updated?
- [ ] Has the glossary been updated with new terms?

### Regular Maintenance

- Review and update concise versions monthly
- Check for contradictions between documents quarterly
- Consolidate related concepts when they become too fragmented
- Archive outdated versions rather than deleting them

## Special Rules

### Histologic-Specific Considerations

1. **Factorepo Consistency**: Any fact mentioned must be traceable and non-contradictory
2. **Multiple Truths**: Different histonations can have different "truths" - track these carefully
3. **Temporal Precision**: Be specific about when events occur
4. **Geographic Clarity**: Define territories and histocircles clearly
5. **Technology Limits**: The Judge and factorepo systems have limits - define them

### Conflict Generation

Every worldbuilding element should answer:
- How can this go wrong?
- Who benefits from this?
- Who is harmed by this?
- What happens at the edges/extremes?
- What do people fight about regarding this?

## File Management

### When to Create New Documents

- New major worldbuilding concept
- New character with significant role
- New plot arc or novel outline
- New technology or social system
- New histonation or faction

### When to Update Existing Documents

- Clarifying existing concepts
- Adding examples or details
- Fixing contradictions
- Expanding on established ideas
- Adding cross-references

## Collaboration Notes

When working with AI assistance:
1. Specify which documents to load for context
2. Request concise versions for broad context
3. Request full versions for detailed work
4. Ask for contradiction checks before finalizing
5. Request updates to both versions when making changes
