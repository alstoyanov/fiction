# Getting Started with Histologic Universe

## Welcome!

You now have a complete foundation for building your science fiction novel universe. This guide will walk you through the first steps.

## What You Have

✅ **Complete worldbuilding framework** - Core system and society documented
✅ **Dual-version system** - Full and concise versions for context management
✅ **Character template** - Comprehensive framework for character creation
✅ **Plot template** - Complete structure for story development

## Your First Session: 30-Minute Quick Start

### Step 1: Understand the World (10 minutes)

Read these in order:
1. `reference/quick-start-guide.md` - Overview and how to work
2. `worldbuilding/core-system-concise.md` - The histologic system

**You'll understand:**
- Factorepo stores all facts, verified for contradictions
- The Judge resolves disputes using factorepo
- Histonations are defined by shared belief in history
- Doubters become outlaws (corrected or exiled)
- Most wars are over disputed historical facts

### Step 2: Get Inspired (10 minutes)

Browse `reference/story-idea-generator.md` and pick:
- A character type (Believer, Doubter, Outlaw, or Authority)
- An inciting incident (Discovery, Relationship, System Event, or Crisis)
- A central conflict (Internal, External, or both)

**Example combinations:**
- Corrector + Correction Failure + Duty vs. Conscience
- Secret Doubter + Forbidden Love + Love vs. Belief
- Judge Operator + Judge Malfunction + Truth vs. Power

## Common First-Time Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't: Ignore the surveillance
Every action is recorded. Characters can't do things secretly without addressing how they avoid detection.

### ✅ Do: Make surveillance central to plot
Use the factorepo as both obstacle and tool. Characters must work within or around it.

---

### ❌ Don't: Make The Judge all-powerful
The Judge has limits. It can only work with facts in the factorepo and logical deduction.

### ✅ Do: Show The Judge's limitations
Explore edge cases, ambiguities, and situations where logic isn't enough.

---

### ❌ Don't: Forget other histonations exist
Your story's histonation isn't alone. Others have different truths.

### ✅ Do: Reference the larger world
Show how international relations work, mention other nations, create context.

---

### ❌ Don't: Make correction too simple
Forcing someone to believe is complex and morally fraught.

### ✅ Do: Explore correction's complexity
Show the process, the resistance, the moral cost, the failures.

---

### ❌ Don't: Let characters have unexplained privacy
In this world, privacy requires justification and effort.

### ✅ Do: Address privacy explicitly
Show how characters create private moments, or show the cost of having none.

---

### ❌ Don't: Forget the dual-version system
Every major document needs both full and concise versions.

### ✅ Do: Maintain both versions
Update concise when full changes significantly. Keep them in sync.

---

### ❌ Don't: Create contradictions with established worldbuilding
Check your ideas against existing documents.

### ✅ Do: Use the consistency checklist
Review PROJECT-RULES.md before finalizing new content.

## Working with AI Assistance

### Starting a New Session

**Load these documents first:**
1. `reference/quick-start-guide.md`
2. `worldbuilding/core-system-concise.md`
3. `worldbuilding/society-structure-concise.md`
4. `reference/glossary.md`

**Then add:**
- Character documents you're working on
- Plot outline if writing a story
- Full worldbuilding docs for areas you're developing

**This gives AI complete context in ~5,000 words**

### Asking for Help

**Good requests:**
- "Help me develop a character who is a corrector questioning their role"
- "Outline a plot about lovers from incompatible histonations"
- "Expand the worldbuilding around how education works"
- "Check this scene for consistency with the factorepo system"

**Less effective requests:**
- "Write my novel" (too broad)
- "Make it better" (too vague)
- "Add more action" (doesn't engage with unique worldbuilding)

### Maintaining Consistency

**Before each session:**
- Load relevant concise documents
- Review glossary for terminology
- Check concept map for relationships

**After creating content:**
- Ask AI to check for contradictions
- Update both full and concise versions
- Add new terms to glossary
- Update document index

### Stuck on Writing?
→ Start with a small scene
→ Show the world through character's eyes
→ Focus on the unique aspects (factorepo, surveillance, doubt)

### Stuck on Consistency?
→ Load all concise documents
→ Check glossary for terminology
→ Review concept map for relationships
→ Use consistency checklist in PROJECT-RULES.md

## Your First Scene Challenge

Try writing this scene to test your understanding:

**Setup:** A character is being questioned by an authority figure about something they did (or didn't do) yesterday.

**Requirements:**
- Show how the factorepo is used in the questioning
- Demonstrate the lack of privacy
- Reveal character's relationship to truth
- Create tension (are they in trouble? why?)
- Show the world through specific details

**This scene will force you to engage with:**
- How surveillance works
- How facts are accessed and used
- How characters feel about the system
- How conflict emerges in this world

## Remember

The Histologic universe is about the tension between **absolute truth and human freedom**. Every story should explore this in some way.

**Good stories in this universe:**
- Make the factorepo central to the plot
- Show the cost of perfect certainty
- Explore the value of doubt
- Question the nature of truth
- Examine what makes us human

**Great stories in this universe:**
- Make readers question their own assumptions
- Show both benefits and costs of the system
- Create characters we care about in impossible situations
- Explore philosophical questions through compelling drama
- Leave readers thinking long after the story ends
