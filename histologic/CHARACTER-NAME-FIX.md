# Character Name Conflict Resolution

**Date:** November 24, 2025

## Issue Identified

There was a naming conflict between two different characters both named "Kade":

1. **Enforcer Kade** (male) - Appears in short stories 01 and 02
2. **Supervisor Kade** (female) - Appears in Novel 04 (The Correction)

These are clearly two different people in different roles and different genders.

## Characters

### Enforcer Kade (UNCHANGED)
- **Role:** Senior Enforcement Officer
- **Gender:** Male
- **Appears in:** 
  - Story 01: The Believer's Fall
  - Story 02: The Stolen Fact
- **Function:** Questions Marcus after he reports Elena; arrests outlaws; processes enforcement cases
- **Age:** ~40 years old
- **Character traits:** Professional, matter-of-fact, follows protocol strictly

### Supervisor Hayes (RENAMED from "Supervisor Kade")
- **Role:** Correctional Facility Supervisor
- **Gender:** Female
- **Appears in:** 
  - Novel 04: The Correction (Prologue)
- **Function:** Processes Marcus on arrival at Ashford Correctional Facility; assigns him to Group Seven
- **Character traits:** Not unkind, somewhat sympathetic, believes in the correction process

## Changes Made

### Files Updated:

1. **novels/04-the-correction/chapters/00-prologue.md**
   - Changed all instances of "Supervisor Kade" to "Supervisor Hayes"
   - Changed "Kade said" to "Hayes said"
   - Changed "Kade's expression" to "Hayes's expression"
   - Changed "Kade pressed" to "Hayes pressed"
   - Changed "Kade looked away" to "Hayes looked away"
   - Changed "Kade had said" to "Hayes had said"

2. **novels/04-the-correction/chapters-summaries/00-prologue-summary.md**
   - Updated character reference from "Supervisor Kade" to "Supervisor Hayes"

3. **novels/04-the-correction/html-export/00-prologue.html**
   - Updated all HTML references to match the markdown changes

4. **novels/04-the-correction/the-correction.epub**
   - Regenerated EPUB with corrected character name

## Rationale

The name "Hayes" was chosen because:
- It's distinctly different from "Kade" to avoid any confusion
- It's a gender-neutral surname that works well for a female character
- It maintains the professional, authoritative tone appropriate for a correctional facility supervisor
- It's easy to remember and pronounce

## Character Database

The character database already correctly lists only "Enforcer Kade" as a character. No updates needed there, but we should add "Supervisor Hayes" as a minor character if we create expanded character documentation.

## Verification

All instances of "Supervisor Kade" have been replaced with "Supervisor Hayes" in:
- ✅ Prologue chapter (markdown)
- ✅ Prologue summary
- ✅ HTML export
- ✅ EPUB file (regenerated)

"Enforcer Kade" remains unchanged in all short story files.

## Impact

This is a minor character who appears only briefly in the prologue of The Correction. The change:
- Eliminates confusion between two different characters
- Maintains consistency across the series
- Does not affect any plot points or character relationships
- Requires no changes to other novels (Hayes doesn't appear elsewhere)
