## Prompt

Write the next book in the Histologic series - "Battle of Truths" (Novel 7). Keep close to the plot summary in `07-battle-of-truths-full.md`. First write all chapter summaries in separate files, then expand each one.

## Key Considerations

### Critical Plot Point from Novel 6
**THE IRONY**: In Novel 6 ("The Distributed Truth"), Marcus REFUSED to execute the seduction operation on Adrian Kovač, choosing transparency instead. He SAVED Adrian by refusing. Now in Novel 7, Marcus must execute that exact operation, DESTROYING the man he saved. This is the core tragedy.

### Foundation Fragments Already Revealed
**Novel 5 (The Lost Hour)**:
- Page 3: Introduction (centralize, mechanize, enforce)
- Principle Four: Ideological Correction Over Punishment
- Principle Six: Narrative Preemption

**Novel 6 (The Distributed Truth)**:
- Principle Three: Strategic Ambiguity Through Backup Control
- Principle Five: Controlled Conflict
- Compiler's Introduction (17 contributors, post-democratic design)
- Compiler's Warning (regret, no reform path)
- Principle Six (expanded): Designed Authoritarianism
- On the End of Designed Conflicts

### Available for Novel 7
- Principle One: [Most foundational - save for key moment]
- Principle Two: [Could reveal mid-novel]
- Principle Seven: [Could reveal late-novel]
- Additional Compiler notes
- Other contributors' perspectives

### Songs to Consider (Mikhail's Repertoire)
- "Sympathy for the Devil" (Rolling Stones) - moral compromise
- "The End" (The Doors) - relationships ending
- "Hurt" (Nine Inch Nails/Cash) - regret and pain
- "Mad World" (Tears for Fears) - dystopian reality
- "Losing My Religion" (R.E.M.) - loss of faith
- "The Sound of Silence" (Simon & Garfunkel) - inability to communicate
- "War" (Edwin Starr) - what is it good for
- "Fortunate Son" (CCR) - class warfare

### Character Arcs to Track
- **Marcus**: Peaceful revolutionary → Reluctant spy → Morally compromised
- **Kira**: Strategic exposer → Reluctant accomplice → Questioner
- **Elena**: Confessor of unexecuted plan → Actual executor/seductress
- **Adrian Kovač**: Saved ally → Betrayed victim → Destroyed
- **The Volkovs**: Distributed truth advocates → Espionage enablers
- **Mikhail**: Validated philosopher → Disappointed in compromise

### Themes
1. The corruption of the righteous
2. Truth vs. victory
3. Love as weapon
4. Moral compromise in war
5. Ends justifying means (or not)
