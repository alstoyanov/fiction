# The Lost Hour - Full Plot Outline (Revised)

## High Concept

Three months after escaping the correction facility, Marcus, Kira, and their allies are scattered across nations, each pursuing their own path. When Veridica's factorepo suffers a catastrophic failure, one hour of history (14:00-15:00, November 15, 2106) is permanently erased. As investigators try to reconstruct what happened, they discover that multiple parties—including the escaped inmates—used the lost hour for their own purposes: Marcus and Kira tried to upload evidence of corruption, Isaiah crossed the border with documents, Dr. Tanaka helped defectors escape, and the resistance extracted operatives. But someone also committed murder and orchestrated the erasure itself. The investigation becomes a race to prove what happened before memories fade and the truth is lost forever.

## Core Premise

**The Setup**: November 15, 2106. Three months after the correction facility escape, our heroes are scattered but still fighting. Elena warns them: something big is happening today between 14:00-15:00. Multiple operations are planned. At 15:01, the factorepo fails. One hour of history is gone.

**The Problem**: Without factorepo records, The Judge cannot verify what happened. Legally, anything during the lost hour "didn't happen." This creates both opportunity and danger for our protagonists—they can't be prosecuted for what they did, but they also can't prove what was done to them.

**The Discovery**: Multiple operations occurred during the lost hour:
- Marcus and Kira uploaded corruption evidence (now unprovable)
- Isaiah crossed the border with documents (now "illegal" entry)
- Dr. Tanaka helped defectors escape (now uncertain who left)
- Alexei and Dmitri extracted resistance members (now ghosts)
- Elena coordinated everything (now deniable)
- BUT: Someone murdered a high-ranking official
- AND: Someone deliberately erased the hour to cover it all up

**The Twist**: The erasure was orchestrated by a government insider working for Synthesis. He used the resistance's operations as cover for murder and data theft. Now everyone who acted during the lost hour is suspect, and our heroes must prove their innocence while the real killer tries to eliminate witnesses.
