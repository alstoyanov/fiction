# Histologic Universe - Glossary

## Core Concepts

**Histologic** / **Histologics**
- The exact science of history
- A system that guarantees no event contradicts any other event in the historical record
- The foundation of truth and governance in this future society

**Histofact**
- An individual historical fact
- Must contain: time, location, involved parties
- Stored in the factorepo
- Subject to logical consistency checks

**Factorepo** / **Factrepo**
- Software system that stores all historical facts
- Fast, reliable, and scalable data structure
- Primary repo: globally important facts
- Local repos: personal and regional facts
- All repos are constantly checked for contradictions

**History**
- A list of facts stored in a factorepo
- Defines the shared reality of a histonation
- Must be internally consistent and non-contradictory

## Social Structures

**Histonation**
- A group of people who share the same history
- Defined by belief in a specific factorepo, not by language or tradition
- Each has its own territory (histocircle) and Judge

**Histocircle**
- The territory occupied by a histonation
- Geographic boundaries of a shared historical truth
- Can expand or contract through conflict or migration

**Histobranch**
- A split in historical truth creating a new version of history
- Occurs when significant portion of histonation disagrees with certain facts
- Usually leads to formation of new histonation
- Often causes conflict over territory

**Outlaw** / **Histologic Outlaw**
- Person who questions the truthfulness of their nation's history
- Must either: undergo correction or leave the histocircle
- Cannot remain in histonation while doubting its truth

## Systems and Technology

**The Judge**
- Supercomputer with access to all factorepo of a histonation
- Evaluates legal disputes and determines right from wrong
- Each histonation has its own Judge
- International Judges exist but have limited power due to contradictions between national factorepos

**Corrective Facility**
- Institution where outlaws are "corrected" to believe in the nation's history
- Alternative to exile from the histocircle
- Process and methods: [TO BE DEVELOPED]

**Universal Language**
- Single language spoken by all humanity
- Has direct translation to machine-understandable language
- Eliminates linguistic barriers but not ideological ones

## Conflict and Politics

**Histobranch Conflict**
- War caused by split in histonation over disputed facts
- New histonation must claim territory from parent nation
- Most common type of military conflict
- Often involves internal fighting and military fracturing

**Resource Conflict**
- War over physical resources
- Less common due to high casualties and unclear outcomes
- Winner forces conquered histonation to accept their factorepo
- Losers must accept new history or become outlaws

**Conquest by Division**
- Tactic: introduce false facts to split enemy histonation
- Weakens through internal fighting
- Fractures military force
- Makes conquest easier

**Factorepo Surrender**
- Defeated nation abandons their factorepo
- Accepts conqueror's factorepo as truth
- Those who disagree become outlaws
- Complete ideological conquest

## Truth and Logic

**Truth**
- What is written in the factorepo
- What can be derived through logical deduction from all facts
- Absolute within a histonation
- Relative between different histonations

**Controversy Check**
- Process of verifying new facts against existing factorepo
- Ensures logical consistency
- Prevents contradictions
- Automated and continuous

**Logical Deduction**
- Process of deriving new truths from existing facts
- Used by The Judge in legal decisions
- Foundation of the histologic system
- Must be rigorous and traceable

## Time and Space

**Time**
- Concrete point on a time continuum
- OR: Period between two concrete points
- Must be precisely specified in histofacts
- Critical for consistency checking

**Location**
- Point with radius
- OR: Space bounded by list of points
- Must be precisely specified in histofacts
- Defines where events occurred

**Involved Parties**
- Individual people
- Groups of people
- Inanimate objects
- Must be specified in every histofact

## Terms to Be Developed

- Economic systems
- Education and indoctrination methods
- Technology level and capabilities
- Daily life and culture
- International relations protocols
- Factorepo technical architecture
- The Judge's decision-making process
- Corrective facility methods
- How new facts are added to factorepo
- Who has authority to add facts
- Privacy and surveillance implications
