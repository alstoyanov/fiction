### Histologic vs Non-Histologic (The Cold War)

```
                  SFW        CNT
HISTOLOGIC      HOSTILE    HOSTILE
(All Nations)
```

## Common Story Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Making one nation purely good or evil**
- All nations have logical reasons for their systems
- All nations have costs and benefits

❌ **Ignoring travel restrictions**
- Characters can't easily cross borders
- Each crossing should be significant

❌ **Forgetting factorepo differences**
- Each Histologic nation's factorepo works differently
- This affects how characters think and act

❌ **Underestimating ideological divides**
- These nations genuinely cannot understand each other
- Compromise is extremely difficult

❌ **Ignoring the Cold War**
- Histologic vs. Non-Histologic tension is constant
- Should be background even if not main plot

❌ **Making SFW and CNT cooperate easily**
- Their mutual hatred is stronger than shared enemy
- Any cooperation is temporary and fragile
