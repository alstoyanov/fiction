# Histologic Universe - Quick Start Guide

## For New Writing Sessions

### Essential Context Loading Order

When starting a new writing session or working with AI assistance, load documents in this order for optimal context:

1. **This guide** - Overview and navigation
2. **Glossary** (`reference/glossary.md`) - Terminology
3. **Core System Concise** (`worldbuilding/core-system-concise.md`) - Foundation
4. **Society Structure Concise** (`worldbuilding/society-structure-concise.md`) - Social context
5. **Relevant character concise versions** - Only characters you're working with
6. **Relevant plot outline** - The story you're developing
7. **Full versions as needed** - Deep dives into specific areas

### Maximum Context Efficiency

**For General Worldbuilding**: Load all concise versions (~2,000 words total)
**For Character Work**: Add character-full.md for character being developed
**For Plot Development**: Add plot-full.md and relevant character-full.md files
**For Writing Scenes**: Add all relevant full documents for that scene

## Core Concepts (Ultra-Brief)

**The System**: History is exact science. All facts stored in factorepo, verified for contradictions, used as absolute truth.

**Histonation**: Group of people who share same history (factorepo). Nations defined by belief, not language/ethnicity.

**The Judge**: Supercomputer that resolves disputes using factorepo. Cannot be appealed.

**Outlaws**: People who doubt their nation's history. Must be corrected or exiled.

**Conflicts**: Mostly over disputed historical facts. Winner forces their history on loser.

## Key Questions Every Story Should Address

1. **Which histonation(s)?** - Where does this take place?
2. **What's the factorepo issue?** - What historical truth is at stake?
3. **Who doubts/believes?** - Character relationship to truth
4. **What are the stakes?** - What happens if protagonist fails?
5. **How does The Judge factor in?** - Legal/truth implications

## Common Story Types in This Universe

### The Doubter's Journey
- Protagonist begins questioning their histonation's truth
- Discovers contradictions or alternative facts
- Must choose: correction, exile, or revolution
- **Example hooks**: Historian finds impossible fact, lover from another histonation reveals contradictions

### The Corrector's Dilemma
- Protagonist enforces belief but questions the morality
- Sees victims of the system up close
- Must choose: continue, defect, or reform
- **Example hooks**: Corrector falls for outlaw, discovers correction doesn't work, learns truth is false

### The Histobranch War
- Histonation splits over disputed facts
- Protagonist caught in civil war over truth
- Must choose sides or find third way
- **Example hooks**: Family divided, protagonist causes split, discovery of unifying fact

### The Infiltrator
- Protagonist from one histonation infiltrates another
- Must pretend to believe false history
- Mission complicated by relationships or discoveries
- **Example hooks**: Spy falls in love, discovers own history is false, mission conflicts with conscience

### The Judge Mystery
- The Judge makes inexplicable decision
- Protagonist must uncover why
- Discovers conspiracy or malfunction
- **Example hooks**: Judge operator finds manipulation, impossible judgment, Judge develops consciousness

### The Outlaw Survival
- Protagonist lives outside the system
- Struggles to survive while hunted
- Builds alternative community or fights back
- **Example hooks**: Outlaw colony discovered, infiltration back into histonation, uniting outlaws

## Worldbuilding Gaps to Fill

### High Priority
- [ ] How did the histologic system originate?
- [ ] What technology enables the factorepo?
- [ ] How do corrective facilities actually work?
- [ ] What's the economic system?
- [ ] How is daily life actually lived?

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Education and indoctrination methods
- [ ] Art and culture in this world
- [ ] Religion and philosophy
- [ ] Military structure and tactics
- [ ] Technology level beyond factorepo

### Low Priority (Can develop as needed)
- [ ] Specific histonations and their histories
- [ ] Geographic details of the world
- [ ] Pre-histologic history
- [ ] Alien contact (if relevant)
- [ ] Far future evolution of system

## Writing Tips for This Universe

### Do's
✓ Make factorepo central to plot
✓ Show surveillance and lack of privacy
✓ Explore tension between truth and freedom
✓ Use The Judge as plot device
✓ Show different perspectives on same "facts"
✓ Make contradictions matter
✓ Show psychological impact of forced belief

### Don'ts
✗ Ignore the factorepo system
✗ Have characters act without consequences being recorded
✗ Make The Judge too powerful (it has limits)
✗ Forget that different histonations have different truths
✗ Make correction too easy or too impossible
✗ Ignore the surveillance implications
✗ Let characters have privacy without justification

## Consistency Checklist

Before finalizing any story element, check:

- [ ] Does it contradict existing worldbuilding?
- [ ] How would it be recorded in factorepo?
- [ ] How would The Judge view this?
- [ ] What histonation(s) are involved?
- [ ] Are the facts internally consistent?
- [ ] Does it create interesting conflict?
- [ ] Have both full and concise versions been updated?
- [ ] Has glossary been updated with new terms?

## File Naming Conventions

**Characters**: `character-name-full.md` / `character-name-concise.md`
**Plots**: `plot-title-full.md` / `plot-title-concise.md`
**Worldbuilding**: `topic-full.md` / `topic-concise.md`
**Novels**: `novel-name/chapter-XX.md`

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Forgetting surveillance**: Characters can't do anything secretly
2. **Ignoring The Judge**: Major disputes must involve The Judge
3. **Making correction too simple**: It's a complex, morally fraught process
4. **Forgetting other histonations**: They exist and have different truths
5. **Making factorepo infallible**: System has limits and can be manipulated
6. **Ignoring the past**: How did we get here? Why do people accept this?
7. **Forgetting the personal**: Big concepts must affect individual lives

## Story Starters

Need inspiration? Try these:

1. A historian discovers their nation's founding fact is false
2. Two people from incompatible histonations fall in love
3. The Judge awards a case to the "wrong" person
4. A child is born who doesn't appear in any factorepo
5. A corrector realizes correction is actually torture
6. An outlaw community discovers a pre-histologic archive
7. A factorepo administrator is ordered to falsify a fact
8. Two histonations discover their factorepos are compatible
9. The Judge stops working for 24 hours
10. Someone invents a way to delete facts from factorepo

## Next Steps

1. **Read the concise worldbuilding documents** (30 minutes)
2. **Review the glossary** (15 minutes)
3. **Choose a story type** from above
4. **Create a character** using the template
5. **Outline a plot** using the template
6. **Start writing** and let the world come alive!

---

**Remember**: The histologic universe is about the tension between absolute truth and human freedom. Every story should explore this in some way.
