## Core System Architecture

```
THE HISTOLOGIC SYSTEM
        |
        |--- FACTOREPO (stores all facts)
        |         |
        |         |--- Primary Factorepo (global events)
        |         |--- Local Factorepos (personal histories)
        |         |
        |         |--- Verification System (checks contradictions)
        |         |--- Synchronization (keeps repos consistent)
        |
        |--- THE JUDGE (interprets facts)
        |         |
        |         |--- Legal Decisions (resolves disputes)
        |         |--- Fact Derivation (logical deduction)
        |         |--- Contradiction Resolution
        |
        |--- UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE (enables system)
                  |
                  |--- Machine-Readable (direct logic translation)
                  |--- Human-Usable (spoken by all)
```

## Social Structure

```
HISTONATION (defined by shared history)
        |
        |--- TERRITORY (Histocircle)

                  |--- Historians (add specialized facts)
