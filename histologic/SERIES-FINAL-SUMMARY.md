**When**: 2114 (5 years later)
**Genre**: Conspiracy thriller / Philosophical epic
**Tagline**: "They created the system. We'll break the cycle."

Marcus discovers The Architects—twelve people who created the entire Histologic system as a control mechanism. They deliberately designed it to be corruptible, maintained non-Histologic nations as enemies, orchestrated all conflicts. "When people unite, they're ungovernable; when they fight, they're controllable."

Marcus and allies expose them, insert truth into all factorepos simultaneously, unite humanity. Most Architects captured. They flee to CNT. Marcus chooses containment over conquest: "The cycle breaks here."

**Key**: Twenty years later, sustainable peace. Next generation grows up unified. "We didn't create utopia. We created possibility."
