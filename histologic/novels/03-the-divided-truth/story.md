# The Divided Truth

*A Short Story in the Histologic Universe*

---

## Part One: The Hunt

The fog rolled in from Lake Erie like a living thing, thick and gray and hungry. Dmitri Volkov pressed his back against the cold brick wall, his breath forming small clouds in the November air. Somewhere in the maze of abandoned warehouses ahead, The Phantom was waiting.

Or running. With The Phantom, you could never tell.

His earpiece crackled. "Agent Volkov, fact storm incoming. Recommend abort."

Dmitri touched his throat mic. "Negative. I am close."

"Sir, your exposure time this week—"

"I said negative." He cut the connection.

The first wave hit him like a pressure change, a sudden wrongness in the air. The warehouse ahead flickered—for a moment it was abandoned, rust-red and broken. Then it was new, chrome and glass, a Chronos neural interface facility. Then back to abandoned.

His neural interface was receiving contradictory broadcasts. Veridica's towers said the warehouse was abandoned since 2065. Chronos's towers said it was an active facility built in 2069. Both signals hit his hippocampus simultaneously, and his brain couldn't reconcile them. The building flickered because his perception flickered—not reality itself, but his ability to process it.

The building could not decide what it was, because Veridica and Chronos could not agree on its history. Or rather, his brain could not decide what to believe when the interface fed it two incompatible truths at once.

Dmitri's head throbbed. He had been experiencing the headaches for three months now, ever since he had volunteered for extended border duty. The chronic exposure was taking its toll—his neural interface constantly struggling with overlapping broadcasts, his hippocampus stressed by the endless contradictions. He had not reported them. Reporting meant correction, and correction meant failure. He was so close to catching The Phantom. So close to proving himself.

He moved forward, weapon drawn, scanning the shadows. The Phantom had led him here deliberately—another game, another test. The outlaw seemed to know exactly how far to push, how close to let Dmitri get before vanishing like smoke.

A sound. Dmitri spun, aimed at—

Nothing. Just the fog and the flickering building and his own racing heart.

Then he saw it: a message spray-painted on the wall, still wet. The paint dripped like blood.

"WE'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT, AGENT VOLKOV. WE BOTH SERVE LIES."

Dmitri's jaw clenched. Outlaw propaganda. Doubt-seeding. He had seen it a hundred times. It meant nothing.

But his headache intensified, and for just a moment—just one terrible moment—he wondered if The Phantom was right.

Then the moment passed. He was Agent Dmitri Volkov, Fact Enforcement Division, defender of truth. The Phantom was a criminal, a corruptor, a threat to everything that kept society from chaos.

He would catch him. He would prove his loyalty. He would silence the doubt that whispered in his mind during fact storms.

He had to.

Because if he did not, if he failed, if the doubt grew too loud—

He would end up in correction himself.

The fog swallowed him as he pressed deeper into the warehouse district. Behind him, the message on the wall flickered in and out of existence, depending on which nation's factorepo you believed.

---

Across the border zone, in a safe house that changed jurisdictions three times a day, Alexei Volkov watched a young woman cry.

"I can't do this anymore," she whispered, her hands shaking around a cup of tea he had made her. "Every morning I wake up and I don't know what's real. The factorepo says one thing, but I remember something else. My own memories feel like lies."

Alexei leaned forward, his voice gentle. "That's because they are lies. Not your memories—the factorepo. Both of them."

"But how can that be? The system is supposed to guarantee truth. The Judge—"

"The Judge only knows what it's told." Alexei pulled up a holographic display, showing two different historical records for the same building. "Look. Veridica says this structure was built in 2067 as a fact verification center. Chronos says it was built in 2069 as a neural interface clinic. They can't both be true."

The woman stared at the contradictory data, her face pale. "But... which one is right?"

"Maybe neither. Maybe both. The point is, they're using these contradictions as weapons. The fact storms aren't accidents—they're deliberate. They keep us confused, uncertain, easier to control."

"How do you know this?"

Alexei's expression darkened. "Because I've seen the evidence. Because my father died in one of their experiments. Because I've been watching them do this for fifteen years."

The woman set down her tea, her hands steadier now. "What do I do?"

"You have three choices. You can go to correction—let them rebuild your mind until you believe without question. You can stay here and slowly go mad from the contradictions. Or..." He paused, meeting her eyes. "You can leave. There are places beyond the border zone. Neutral territories. Places where you can think for yourself."

"But my family—"

"I know." His voice was soft with understanding. "It's the hardest choice you'll ever make. I can't make it for you."

She was silent for a long moment. Outside, the fog pressed against the windows, and somewhere in the distance, a fact storm siren began to wail.

"How do I leave?" she asked finally.

Alexei felt the familiar mix of relief and guilt. Another mind freed. Another family broken. "I'll arrange transport. But first, you need to understand—once you leave, you can never come back. Not as yourself. The system will mark you as an outlaw. If you return, you'll be corrected or exiled."

"I understand."

Did she? Alexei wondered. Did anyone really understand until they were already gone, already marked, already lost?

He thought of his own family. His mother, slowly dying from decades of fact storm exposure. His brother Nikolai, caught in the middle, trying to hold together something that had shattered years ago. And—

No. He would not think about Dmitri. His other brother had made his choice. Had chosen the system over truth, order over freedom, certainty over family.

Had chosen to hunt him without even knowing it.

"I'll make the arrangements," Alexei said, standing. "Stay here. Don't access any factorepo terminals. Don't contact anyone. I'll be back before dawn."

As he slipped out into the fog-shrouded streets, he pulled up his collar and changed his gait, his posture, becoming someone else. The Phantom. The most wanted outlaw in the border zone.

The man his brother was hunting.

The man who left messages on walls, hoping against hope that Dmitri would understand.

We're not so different, brother, he thought as he vanished into the mist. We're both trying to save people. We've just chosen different sides of an impossible war.

---

In the basement of a factorepo maintenance station, Nikolai Volkov stared at three screens showing three different versions of the same historical event.

According to Veridica: The warehouse district was evacuated in 2068 due to structural concerns. No casualties.

According to Chronos: The warehouse district was cleared in 2069 for neural interface expansion. Seventeen residents relocated.

According to his father's private notes, which Nikolai had found years after his death: The warehouse district was used for fact storm testing in 2068. Forty-three people died. The test was deemed successful.

Nikolai's hands trembled as he archived the contradictions, filed them away in the endless database of lies he maintained. His job was to keep the factorepo systems running, to reconcile the irreconcilable, to make sense of the senseless.

His job was impossible.

His personal terminal chimed. A coded message from Alexei: "Need pickup coordinates. Three days. Usual fee."

Nikolai closed his eyes. Another one. Another person his brother was helping escape. Another person Nikolai would have to provide false documentation for, another trail he would have to cover, another crime he was committing without ever choosing to be a criminal.

He typed back: "Confirmed. Will arrange."

Then he deleted the message, scrubbed the logs, and buried the evidence under seventeen layers of routine maintenance records. He had become very good at hiding things.

His work terminal chimed. A different message, this one official: "Dinner tonight? Your place? —D"

Dmitri. His other brother. The one who did not know about Alexei. The one who talked endlessly about catching The Phantom, about proving himself, about maintaining order in chaos.

The one who was hunting their brother without knowing it.

Nikolai typed back: "1900 hours. I'll cook."

He would sit across from Dmitri and listen to him talk about the investigation. He would nod and ask questions and pretend he did not know that every lead Dmitri followed, every pattern he analyzed, every trap he set was aimed at their own flesh and blood.

He would smile and serve dinner and die a little more inside.

Because that was what Nikolai did. He stood in the middle. He held the pieces together. He betrayed everyone by trying to protect everyone.

He was the bridge between two brothers who had become enemies, and bridges, he was learning, eventually collapse under the weight they carry.

His personal terminal chimed again. Another message, this one from the hospital: "Your mother's condition has deteriorated. Recommend immediate family visit."

Nikolai stared at the message for a long moment. Then he forwarded it to Dmitri's official terminal and Alexei's encrypted one.

Immediate family.

Three brothers who had not been in the same room in fifteen years.

Three brothers who loved each other and could not save each other.

Three brothers who were about to collide.

Nikolai stood, gathered his coat, and headed for the hospital. Behind him, the screens continued their endless display of contradictory truths, facts that could not coexist, histories that could not be reconciled.

Just like his family.

---

The hospital occupied a strange space in the border zone—officially neutral territory, claimed by neither Veridica nor Chronos. In practice, this meant it was claimed by both, its hallways flickering between jurisdictions, its medical records existing in contradictory states.

Dmitri arrived first, still in uniform, his weapon holstered but present. He moved through the corridors with military precision, nodding to the nurses who recognized him. Border Security had a wing here—too many agents broke under the psychological pressure of fact storm exposure.

He tried not to think about that.

His mother's room was on the third floor, in the cognitive trauma ward. The walls here were painted a soft blue that was supposed to be calming. It did not work. Nothing could calm the screaming in people's minds when their memories and the factorepo could not agree on what was real.

Sofya Volkov lay in the bed, her gray hair spread across the pillow, her eyes closed. She looked smaller than Dmitri remembered. Frailer. The machines around her beeped softly, monitoring brain activity, cognitive function, the slow dissolution of a mind that had lived too long in contradictory truth.

"Mama," Dmitri said softly, taking her hand.

Her eyes fluttered open. For a moment, they were clear. "Dima. You came."

"Of course I came."

"Where are your brothers?"

Dmitri's jaw tightened. "Nikolai is coming. He sent the message."

"And Alexei?"

"Mama, Alexei left years ago. You know that."

But did she? Her memories were fragmenting, reality and fiction blending together. Sometimes she remembered Alexei leaving. Sometimes she remembered him dying. Sometimes she remembered him never existing at all.

The fact storms had taken her mind piece by piece, and there was nothing Dmitri could do except watch.

"He'll come," she murmured, her eyes closing again. "All my boys. Together again."

Dmitri sat in the chair beside her bed and waited. Outside, the fog pressed against the windows, and somewhere in the building, a fact storm siren began its low wail.

---

Nikolai arrived twenty minutes later, his technician's uniform rumpled, his face drawn. He looked, Dmitri thought, like he had not slept in days.

"How is she?" Nikolai asked, standing in the doorway.

"Declining. The doctors say her cognitive coherence is below thirty percent. She's..." Dmitri's voice caught. "She's not going to recover."

Nikolai moved to the other side of the bed, taking their mother's other hand. "I know."

They sat in silence, two brothers who looked so alike but had grown so different. Dmitri rigid and controlled, Nikolai anxious and worn.

"You look tired," Dmitri said finally.

"Border zone work. You know how it is."

"You should transfer. Request assignment in the interior. The exposure here—"

"I can't leave, Dima. Mama needs me. And..." Nikolai hesitated. "Someone has to maintain the systems."

"The systems are killing people."

The words came out before Dmitri could stop them. Nikolai's head snapped up, eyes wide.

"What?"

Dmitri looked away. "Nothing. Forget I said anything."

"Dima, are you—are you having doubts?"

"No." Too quick. Too defensive. "No, I'm fine. Just tired. The Phantom case is taking a lot of energy."

"The Phantom." Nikolai's voice was strange. "You're still hunting him?"

"Her. Him. We don't know. They're careful. But I'm close. I can feel it." Dmitri leaned forward, intensity in his eyes. "This outlaw is different from the others. Smarter. More careful. They leave messages, like they're trying to communicate. Like they know me."

Nikolai's face had gone pale. "Maybe you should request reassignment. Let someone else—"

"No. I'm going to catch them. I have to."

"Why? Why does it have to be you?"

Dmitri looked at his mother's sleeping face. "Because I'm from here. Because people like us—border residents—we're always suspect. Always one fact storm away from doubt. I have to prove I'm loyal. I have to prove the system works."

"And if it doesn't?" Nikolai's voice was barely a whisper.

"Then we're all lost."

Before Nikolai could respond, their mother stirred. Her eyes opened, unfocused, confused.

"Ivan?" she called. Their father's name. "Ivan, where are the boys?"

"Mama, it's us," Dmitri said gently. "Nikolai and I are here."

"No, all three. Where's Alexei? He promised he'd come. He promised—"

"Mama, Alexei isn't—"

The door opened.

A man stood in the doorway, wearing civilian clothes, his hair longer than regulation, his posture relaxed. But his face—

Dmitri's hand went to his weapon.

Because the face was his face. The same gray-blue eyes, the same sharp features, the same height and build.

The face was Nikolai's face.

The face was all three of theirs.

"Hello, Mama," Alexei said softly. "I'm here."

---

## Part Two: The Truth

Time seemed to stop.

Dmitri was on his feet, weapon half-drawn, training warring with recognition. The man in the doorway was a stranger. The man in the doorway was his brother. The man in the doorway was—

"The Phantom," Dmitri breathed.

Alexei's eyes met his, and in them Dmitri saw sorrow and resignation and something that might have been hope.

"Hello, Dima."

"Don't—" Dmitri's voice cracked. "Don't call me that."

"It's what Mama called you. What we all called you, before—"

"Before you became a criminal. Before you betrayed everything we—"

"Before you chose the system over your family."

The words hung in the air between them, sharp and cutting. Nikolai stood frozen between them, his face a mask of anguish.

"You knew," Dmitri said, turning to Nikolai. "You knew it was him. You've been helping him."

"Dima, I can explain—"

"Don't. Just—don't."

Their mother's voice, weak but clear: "My boys. All together. I knew you'd come."

She was smiling, her eyes clearer than they had been in months, as if having all three of her sons in the same room had temporarily pushed back the fog in her mind.

"Mama," Alexei moved toward the bed, but Dmitri stepped into his path.

"You're under arrest."

"Dima, please. She's dying. Let me—"

"You're under arrest," Dmitri repeated, his hand on his weapon. "For corruption of believers, for aiding outlaws, for—"

"For what? For telling people the truth? For showing them the contradictions you pretend don't exist?"

"The contradictions are temporary. The system will resolve them. We just need time—"

"It's been fifteen years!" Alexei's voice rose. "Fifteen years since Papa died in one of their fact storm experiments. Fifteen years of watching Mama's mind dissolve. How much more time do you need?"

"Papa's death was an accident. A tragic accident during a natural fact storm—"

"There's no such thing as a natural fact storm!" Alexei pulled out a data chip, held it up. "I have the evidence. Both nations are creating them deliberately. The border zone is a laboratory. They're testing psychological warfare techniques. Papa wasn't a casualty—he was a test subject."

Dmitri's hand tightened on his weapon. "Outlaw propaganda."

"It's the truth! Look at it. Please, just look at it."

"I don't need to look at lies."

"Then look at her!" Alexei pointed at their mother. "Look at what they've done to her. Look at what they're doing to you. You're having headaches, aren't you? Doubts? You're starting to see the contradictions. How long before you end up in a bed like this?"

Dmitri's head throbbed, as if summoned by the words. "I'm fine."

"You're not fine. None of us are fine. We're all dying here, slowly, from exposure to their war. And you're helping them do it."

"I'm maintaining order. I'm protecting people from chaos—"

"You're hunting your own brother!"

The words echoed in the small room. Their mother made a small sound, and Nikolai moved to comfort her, his face wet with tears.

"I didn't know," Dmitri said, his voice hollow. "I didn't know it was you."

"Would it have mattered?"

The question hung between them. Would it have mattered? If Dmitri had known The Phantom was Alexei, would he have stopped hunting? Would he have questioned his orders? Would he have chosen family over duty?

He didn't know. God help him, he didn't know.

"Why?" Dmitri asked finally. "Why did you become this?"

"Because I couldn't watch them kill us and do nothing. Because Papa's death meant something, or it meant nothing, and I couldn't accept nothing. Because—" Alexei's voice broke. "Because someone had to try to save us."

"You can't save us by destroying the system that holds society together."

"The system is already destroying us. I'm just trying to get people out before it kills them too."

Dmitri looked at his brother—his identical brother, his triplet, his mirror image who had made every opposite choice. Alexei looked back, and in that moment, they were children again, three boys who had been inseparable, who had finished each other's sentences, who had been one person in three bodies.

Before their father died.

Before the world split them apart.

"I have to arrest you," Dmitri said quietly.

"I know."

"I have to report Nikolai."

"I know."

"I have to—"

"My boys," their mother whispered. "Don't fight. Please don't fight."

But it was too late for that. It had been too late for fifteen years.

Dmitri reached for his communicator.

Nikolai's hand caught his wrist.

"Don't," Nikolai said, his voice steady for the first time. "Please, Dima. Not yet. Let us have this moment. Let her have this moment. She's dying. Let her die with all three of us here."

Dmitri looked at Nikolai's hand on his wrist, at his brother's tear-stained face, at Alexei standing by their mother's bed, at the woman who had given birth to all three of them in the same hour, who had loved them equally, who was leaving them.

"Five minutes," he said hoarsely. "Then I do my duty."

Alexei nodded and moved to the bed. Dmitri followed. Nikolai was already there.

Three brothers, three identical faces, gathered around their dying mother.

Sofya Volkov looked up at them, and her smile was radiant. "My beautiful boys. My triplets. I knew you'd come together. I knew—"

A fact storm siren wailed.

The lights flickered.

The room seemed to shift, reality bending at the edges. Through the window, the fog outside turned strange colors—purple, green, colors that shouldn't exist.

Their mother gasped, her body going rigid. The machines around her began to scream.

"Mama!" All three brothers reached for her at once.

But she was seizing, her mind fragmenting under the assault of contradictory facts, her brain unable to reconcile the impossible.

"Get a doctor!" Dmitri shouted.

Nikolai ran for the door, but it wouldn't open. The fact storm had locked down the building, sealing them in.

Alexei held their mother's hand, his voice urgent: "Mama, stay with us. Stay with us. Don't let them take you. Don't—"

But Sofya Volkov's eyes had gone distant, seeing things that weren't there, or were there, or had never been there, or would always be there. The fact storm was showing her every possible history at once, and her mind, already fragile, shattered under the weight.

"Ivan," she whispered. "Ivan, I see you. I see—"

Her eyes found her sons, all three of them, and for just a moment, she was lucid again.

"Save each other," she said. "Promise me. Save each other."

Then she was gone.

The machines flatlined. The fact storm raged. Three brothers stood around their mother's body, and the world flickered between truths, unable to decide what was real.

---

*Fifteen years earlier*

Three boys sat on the roof of their apartment building, watching the fog roll in from the lake. They were twelve years old, identical in every way, and they were arguing about which of them had been born first.

"I was," Dmitri insisted. "Mama said I came out first."

"By thirty seconds," Nikolai countered. "That doesn't count."

"It counts for birth order. I'm the oldest."

"You're the bossiest," Alexei said, grinning. "That's different."

Dmitri shoved him, and Alexei shoved back, and then they were wrestling, laughing, rolling across the roof while Nikolai watched and shook his head.

"You're both idiots," Nikolai said, but he was smiling.

Their father's voice called from below: "Boys! Dinner!"

They raced down the stairs, three identical figures moving in perfect synchronization, and burst into the apartment where their mother was setting the table and their father was pulling something from the oven.

"Wash your hands," Sofya said automatically.

They did, jostling for space at the sink, still laughing.

Dinner was loud and chaotic, three boys talking over each other, finishing each other's sentences, existing in that perfect unity that only triplets know.

After dinner, their father called them into his study. His face was serious.

"I need to tell you something," Ivan Volkov said. "About my work."

The boys sat, suddenly quiet. Their father worked for the factorepo maintenance division. He rarely talked about it.

"The system we live under," Ivan began carefully, "it's supposed to guarantee truth. But truth is more complicated than the factorepo admits. Sometimes facts contradict. Sometimes history isn't clear. And when that happens—"

"Fact storms," Dmitri said. He'd been reading about them.

"Yes. Fact storms. They're getting worse. The border zone is becoming unstable. Your mother and I—we've been thinking about moving. Going interior, where it's safer."

"But this is our home," Alexei protested.

"I know. But I want you boys to understand something. The system isn't perfect. It's run by people, and people make mistakes. If anything ever happens to me, I want you to remember that. I want you to think for yourselves. Question things. Don't just accept what you're told."

"Papa, you're scaring us," Nikolai said quietly.

Ivan smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. "I'm sorry. I just—I want you to be prepared. The world is more complicated than it seems. And you three—you're special. You have each other. No matter what happens, promise me you'll stay together. Promise me you'll take care of each other."

"We promise," they said in unison, the way triplets do.

Three years later, Ivan Volkov died in a fact storm.

Three years after that, the boys stopped being one person in three bodies.

They became three separate people, each carrying a different piece of what they'd been.

Dmitri carried the order.

Alexei carried the questions.

Nikolai carried the guilt.

And none of them could save the others.

---

*Present*

The fact storm ended as suddenly as it had begun. The lights stabilized. The building unlocked. The world decided what it was again.

But Sofya Volkov was still dead.

Dmitri stood over her body, his face a mask. Alexei was crying silently. Nikolai had his arms wrapped around himself, rocking slightly.

"I'm sorry," a doctor said, entering the room. "The fact storm—her mind couldn't handle the stress. There was nothing we could do."

Dmitri nodded mechanically. "I understand."

"I'll give you time with her. Take as long as you need."

The doctor left. The three brothers stood in silence.

"She asked us to save each other," Nikolai said finally. "That was her last wish."

"We can't," Dmitri said. "It's too late."

"It's not too late. Dima, please. Look at the evidence. Just look at it. If you see what I've seen, what Alexei's seen—"

"It doesn't matter what I see. I have a duty."

"To what? To a system that killed our father? That killed our mother? That's killing you?"

Dmitri's hand went to his temple, where the headache pulsed. "The system maintains order. Without it, there's only chaos."

"Without it, there's freedom," Alexei said. "There's truth. Real truth, not manufactured certainty."

"Your truth is just another kind of certainty. You're as rigid as I am, just in the opposite direction."

"At least I'm not hunting my own brother."

"You're corrupting people. Destroying families. Spreading doubt that leads to—to this." Dmitri gestured at their mother's body.

"The doubt didn't kill her. The fact storms did. The system did. The war between two versions of truth that can't coexist."

"Then we need one truth. One system. That's the only way—"

"Whose truth, Dima? Veridica's? Chronos's? Yours? Mine? Who gets to decide?"

"The Judge decides."

"The Judge only knows what it's told. It's a computer, not a god."

They were shouting now, years of separation and anger and grief pouring out. Nikolai stood between them, literally and figuratively, his face anguished.

"Stop," Nikolai said. "Please, both of you, stop. This is what they want. This is how they win. They set us against each other, and we tear ourselves apart, and they don't have to do anything."

"Who's they?" Dmitri demanded.

"Both nations. Both systems. Everyone who benefits from keeping us divided and uncertain and afraid."

"That's conspiracy thinking—"

"It's the truth!" Nikolai pulled out his own data chip. "I've been maintaining the systems for ten years. I've seen the code. I've seen the deliberate contradictions. I've seen the fact storm generators. Papa was right—it's all manufactured. The border zone is an experiment in psychological control, and we're the test subjects."

Dmitri stared at the chip in Nikolai's hand. "You've been compromised. Both of you. The exposure—"

"The exposure opened our eyes," Alexei said. "Look at the data, Dima. Please. For Papa. For Mama. For us."

Dmitri looked at his brothers—his identical brothers, his triplets, his mirrors. He looked at his mother's body. He looked at his hands, which were shaking.

He looked at the truth he'd been avoiding for three months.

He was compromised. He was doubting. He was becoming what he'd sworn to fight.

And maybe—maybe that wasn't corruption.

Maybe it was clarity.

"Show me," he said quietly.

---

They went to Alexei's safe house, moving through the fog-shrouded streets like ghosts. Dmitri had disabled his tracker, a crime in itself. Nikolai had wiped the hospital security footage. Alexei led them through routes that flickered between jurisdictions, impossible to follow.

The safe house was in an old factory that Veridica claimed was abandoned and Chronos claimed was a neural interface training facility. In reality, it was neither and both.

Alexei pulled up the data on a holographic display. Dmitri watched, his face expressionless, as fifteen years of evidence unfolded before him.

Fact storm generators. Deliberate contradictions. Psychological warfare protocols. Test results showing optimal levels of cognitive dissonance for population control.

And buried in the files: a report on Test Subject 2471, also known as Ivan Volkov. Cause of death: cerebral hemorrhage induced by controlled fact storm exposure. Result: successful demonstration of lethal threshold.

Dmitri's father hadn't died in an accident.

He'd been murdered.

"They killed him," Dmitri said, his voice hollow. "They killed him to test their weapons."

"Yes," Alexei said gently.

"And Mama—"

"Collateral damage. Acceptable losses. That's what the reports call people like her."

Dmitri sat down heavily. His entire worldview was crumbling, fact by fact, truth by truth. Everything he'd believed, everything he'd fought for, everything he'd sacrificed—

It was built on lies.

"What do we do?" he asked, and his voice was the voice of a lost child, not a Border Security agent.

"We expose it," Alexei said. "We take this evidence to Synthesis. They're the only nation that might listen. They're trying to reconcile contradictions, not weaponize them. If we can get this data to them—"

"They'll bury it," Nikolai interrupted. "Synthesis is still Histologic. They still benefit from the system. They won't destroy it."

"Then what?" Alexei demanded. "We just accept it? Let them keep killing people?"

"No. We—"

The door exploded inward.

Border Security agents poured in, weapons drawn. At their head was Captain Yevgenia Sokolov, her face hard.

"Agent Volkov," she said. "Step away from the outlaws."

Dmitri stood slowly. "Captain. How did you—"

"I've been tracking you for three months. Ever since your fact storm exposure exceeded safe limits. I knew you'd be compromised eventually. I just needed you to lead me to The Phantom." Her eyes moved to Alexei. "And his network."

"Captain, you need to see this evidence. The fact storms are—"

"Manufactured. Yes, I know."

Dmitri froze. "You know?"

"Of course I know. I'm part of the program. Border Security has been running the tests for years. Very successful, overall. Some casualties, but acceptable given the strategic value."

"You—" Dmitri couldn't find words. "You're part of it."

"I'm a patriot. I serve Veridica. The fact storms keep the border zone unstable, which prevents Chronos from claiming it. They also provide valuable data on psychological resilience. Your father's death, for instance, helped us refine the protocols."

"My father was a person. My mother was a person. They weren't data points—"

"They were citizens of Veridica. They served their nation. As you should have." Sokolov's expression hardened. "But you've been compromised. All three of you. Dmitri Volkov, you're under arrest for failure to report psychological compromise and for aiding known outlaws. Alexei Volkov, you're under arrest for corruption of believers and conspiracy against the state. Nikolai Volkov, you're under arrest for aiding outlaws and unauthorized access to classified systems."

"You can't—" Alexei started.

"I can. And I will. You'll all be sent to correction. They'll rebuild your minds. Make you useful again."

"Or erase us completely," Nikolai said quietly.

Sokolov smiled. "If necessary."

Dmitri looked at his brothers. Alexei met his eyes, and in that moment, they understood each other perfectly. Nikolai nodded slightly.

Three brothers. One thought.

They moved as one.

Dmitri drew his weapon and fired at the ceiling, bringing down debris. Alexei triggered a smoke grenade he'd hidden in his jacket. Nikolai hit the emergency power cutoff.

The room plunged into chaos.

"Go!" Dmitri shouted. "The tunnel!"

They ran, three identical figures moving in perfect synchronization, the way they had as children. Behind them, agents shouted and weapons fired, but the smoke and darkness bought them seconds.

Alexei led them to a hidden passage, down into the tunnels beneath the factory. They ran through darkness, their breathing synchronized, their footsteps echoing.

"Where are we going?" Dmitri gasped.

"The border. If we can get to Chronos territory—"

"They'll arrest us too. We're Veridica citizens."

"Then we go to Synthesis. Or SFW. Anywhere but here."

They burst out of the tunnel into fog-shrouded streets. Behind them, sirens wailed. Searchlights cut through the mist.

"Split up," Nikolai said. "We're easier to track together."

"No," Dmitri said. "We stay together. We promised Papa. We stay together."

So they ran together, three brothers who had been separated for fifteen years, finally united in flight.

They almost made it.

The checkpoint appeared out of the fog without warning. Border Security on one side, Chronos enforcement on the other. Trapped between two nations, neither of which would show mercy.

"Surrender," Sokolov's voice boomed from a loudspeaker. "There's nowhere to go."

The three brothers stood back to back, surrounded, as the fog swirled around them.

"I'm sorry," Dmitri said. "I should have listened. I should have seen—"

"We all should have," Alexei said. "We all chose our certainties over each other."

"I tried to hold us together," Nikolai said. "I failed."

"No," Dmitri said. "You were the only one who tried. You were the only one who saw that there might be another way."

"And now we're all going to correction."

"Maybe," Alexei said. "Or maybe we resist. Maybe we fight. Maybe we—"

"Maybe we accept it," Dmitri said quietly. "Maybe we face it together. The way we should have faced everything."

He dropped his weapon. Alexei and Nikolai stared at him.

"Dima—"

"We can't win this fight. Not here. Not now. But maybe—maybe in correction, we can remember. Maybe we can hold on to who we are. To each other."

"They'll erase us."

"They'll try. But we're triplets. We're three parts of one person. If we remember that—if we hold on to that—maybe they can't completely destroy us."

It was a desperate hope. A fragile hope.

But it was all they had.

Alexei dropped his weapon. Nikolai followed.

Three brothers stood together as the agents closed in, as the fog swallowed them, as the world they'd known ended.

And began again.

## Part Three: The Correction

The correctional facility was built in the neutral zone between Veridica and Chronos, a place where neither nation's factorepo held absolute sway. It was the only place both nations agreed on anything: outlaws needed correction.

The intake process was mechanical, efficient, dehumanizing. Three brothers were separated, processed, cataloged. Their possessions were taken. Their identities were recorded. Their crimes were filed.

Then they were led to their cells.

The cells were arranged in a triangle, transparent walls allowing each brother to see the others but not speak to them. Psychological pressure through proximity. They could watch each other break.

Dmitri sat on his bunk and stared at his hands. They were shaking. They hadn't stopped shaking since the arrest, since Captain Sokolov had read the charges, since he'd realized that everything he'd believed was—

No. He couldn't think that way. That was the doubt talking. That was the corruption.

But his hands kept shaking.

Across the corridor, through the transparent wall, he could see Alexei. His brother—his identical brother, his triplet—sat cross-legged on his bunk, eyes closed, breathing slowly. Meditating or praying or simply enduring. Alexei looked calm. Alexei looked free, even in a cell.

Dmitri hated him for that. Or envied him. He couldn't tell anymore.

To his left, Nikolai paced. Three steps forward, three steps back, endless repetition. Nikolai's face was gray, his eyes hollow. Of the three of them, Nikolai looked the most broken. The mediator, the bridge, the one who'd tried to hold them together—and failed.

They could see each other but couldn't speak. The cells were soundproofed. They could only watch.

A guard approached Dmitri's cell, slid a datapad through the slot. Official notification. Dmitri read it once, twice, three times, but the words didn't change.

ELENA VOLKOV. DECEASED. COGNITIVE FAILURE SECONDARY TO PROLONGED FACT STORM EXPOSURE. REMAINS WILL BE PROCESSED ACCORDING TO STANDARD PROTOCOLS. NO FAMILY VIEWING PERMITTED.

Their mother was dead, and they couldn't even attend her funeral.

Dmitri looked up. The guard was delivering the same message to his brothers. He watched Alexei's face crumple, watched Nikolai stop pacing and sink to the floor.

Three identical faces. Three identical expressions of grief.

They'd been trying to save her, each in their own way. Dmitri by maintaining order. Alexei by fighting the system that killed their father and was killing her. Nikolai by keeping them all together.

All three had failed.

---

The correction began the next day.

They were taken separately to white rooms with white chairs and white walls. Technicians attached neural interfaces—even in Veridica facilities, they used Chronos technology for this. The irony wasn't lost on Dmitri.

A voice, calm and mechanical: "State your name."

"Dmitri Ivanovich Volkov."

"State your crime."

"I—" He hesitated. What was his crime? Doubting? Questioning? Seeing the truth?

"State your crime," the voice repeated.

"Failure to report psychological compromise. Aiding known outlaws."

"Do you accept your guilt?"

Did he? He'd broken the rules. He'd violated his oath. He'd chosen his brothers over his duty.

"Yes," he said. "I accept my guilt."

"Do you wish to be corrected?"

No. He wanted to be free. He wanted to think for himself. He wanted his brothers and his mother and his father and the childhood when they'd all been one person in four bodies.

But that was gone. All of it was gone.

"Yes," he lied. "I wish to be corrected."

The neural interface activated.

Pain.

Not physical pain—mental pain. The sensation of thoughts being pulled apart, examined, judged. Memories surfacing: his father's death, his mother's decline, The Phantom's messages, Alexei's face in the hospital, the evidence of manufactured fact storms.

The voice: "These memories are corrupted. They contain doubt. They must be corrected."

"No—"

But the process had begun. His memories were being rewritten, fact by fact. His father's death became an accident again. His mother's decline became natural deterioration. The evidence became outlaw propaganda.

Dmitri fought. He tried to hold on to the truth, to what he'd learned, to who he was.

But the correction was relentless.

---

In another white room, Alexei faced the same process.

"State your name."

"Alexei Ivanovich Volkov."

"State your crime."

"Telling the truth. Freeing minds. Loving my family more than your system."

"Incorrect. State your crime."

"That is my crime. In your world, truth is crime. Freedom is crime. Love is crime."

"You are corrupted. You will be corrected."

"You can change my memories, but you can't change what I know. You can't change who I am."

"We will see."

The neural interface activated. Alexei screamed.

His memories surfaced: his father's last words, his mother's smile, the people he'd helped escape, Dmitri's face when he'd finally understood, Nikolai's tears.

The voice: "These memories contain rebellion. They must be corrected."

"They contain truth. They contain love. You can't correct those."

"We will see."

But Alexei fought. He'd spent fifteen years resisting, questioning, refusing to accept manufactured certainty. He wouldn't stop now.

Even as his memories began to blur and shift, he held on to one thing: his brothers' faces. Three identical faces. Three parts of one whole.

They couldn't take that from him.

They couldn't.

---

In a third white room, Nikolai faced his correction.

"State your name."

"Nikolai Ivanovich Volkov."

"State your crime."

"I tried to save everyone. I tried to hold us together. I tried to find a middle way."

"Incorrect. State your crime."

"That is my crime. There is no middle way. You force us to choose sides, and anyone who refuses is guilty."

"You aided outlaws. You accessed classified systems. You betrayed your nation."

"I tried to save my family."

"Your nation is your family."

"My nation killed my father. My nation killed my mother. My nation is killing my brothers. Some family."

The neural interface activated. Nikolai didn't scream. He just closed his eyes and let the tears fall.

His memories surfaced: standing between his brothers, always between, always trying to bridge the unbridgeable. Watching them drift apart. Watching them become enemies. Failing to save any of them.

The voice: "These memories contain guilt. They must be corrected."

"The guilt is real. The guilt is earned. You can't correct reality."

"We will see."

But Nikolai had been living in contradictory realities for fifteen years. He'd been maintaining impossible systems, reconciling irreconcilable facts, holding together what couldn't be held.

If anyone could resist correction, it was the man who'd been correcting himself every day just to survive.

---

Days passed. Weeks. The correction continued.

But something was wrong.

The technicians noticed it first: the three subjects were responding identically. When Dmitri's memories were altered, Alexei and Nikolai showed the same neural patterns. When Alexei resisted, Dmitri and Nikolai's brain activity spiked in sympathy.

They were triplets. Their neural patterns were nearly identical. And somehow, impossibly, they were connected.

The correction that worked on individuals was failing on them because they weren't individuals. They were three parts of one consciousness, and you couldn't correct one without correcting all three.

And correcting all three at once was proving impossible.

The facility director reviewed the data, frowning. "This is unprecedented."

"What do we do?" a technician asked.

"Increase the intensity. Separate them completely. No visual contact. Break the connection."

So they moved the brothers to isolation cells, deep in the facility where they couldn't see each other, couldn't sense each other.

But it didn't matter.

Because they'd spent nine months in the same womb. They'd spent twelve years as one person in three bodies. They'd spent fifteen years apart but still connected by blood and memory and love.

You couldn't separate what had never truly been separate.

---

In his isolation cell, Dmitri dreamed.

He dreamed of being twelve years old, sitting on a roof with his brothers, arguing about who was born first.

He dreamed of his father's study, of the warning: "Question things. Don't just accept what you're told."

He dreamed of Alexei's face in the hospital: "We're not so different, brother."

He dreamed of Nikolai's tears: "I tried to hold us together."

He dreamed of three boys who had been one, and three men who had forgotten how to be.

And in the dream, his father's voice: "No matter what happens, promise me you'll stay together."

We promised, Dmitri thought. We promised, and we broke that promise, and it broke us.

But maybe it's not too late.

Maybe we can still save each other.

---

In his isolation cell, Alexei meditated.

He focused on his breath, on the core of who he was, on the truth that no correction could erase.

He was Alexei Volkov. He was a brother. He was a son. He was a man who'd chosen freedom over certainty, truth over comfort, family over system.

They could change his memories, but they couldn't change his choice.

He would resist. He would endure. He would remember.

For his father. For his mother. For his brothers.

For the boy he'd been, who'd sat on a roof and dreamed of flying.

---

In his isolation cell, Nikolai calculated.

He was a technician. He understood systems. And the correction system had a flaw: it assumed individual consciousness.

But triplets weren't individual. They were distributed consciousness. Three nodes of one network.

If he could just—if he could find a way to—

The neural interface in his cell. It was connected to the facility's main system. And he'd spent ten years maintaining factorepo systems. He knew how to access, how to manipulate, how to—

His fingers moved, tracing patterns on the wall that only he could see. Code. Backdoors. Exploits.

He couldn't free them. But maybe he could preserve them. Maybe he could hide their true memories in the system itself, buried so deep that the correction couldn't find them.

Three brothers. Three sets of memories. Three copies of the truth.

Distributed. Redundant. Impossible to fully erase.

It was a desperate plan. It probably wouldn't work.

But it was all he had.

---

Six months into correction, the facility director admitted defeat.

"They're not responding to standard protocols. The triplet connection is too strong. We can suppress their memories, but we can't erase them. We can force compliance, but we can't create genuine belief."

"What do you recommend?" Captain Sokolov asked. She'd come to observe personally.

"Permanent detention. Keep them sedated. They're too dangerous to release."

"That's not correction. That's imprisonment."

"It's the best we can do."

Sokolov stared at the monitors showing three identical men in three identical cells. Three brothers who'd chosen each other over everything, even at the cost of their freedom, their minds, their lives.

"Very well," she said. "Permanent detention. Log them as correction failures. Case closed."

She turned to leave, then paused.

"Captain?" the director asked.

"Nothing. Just—" She looked back at the monitors. "They really loved each other, didn't they? The brothers."

"Yes. That was the problem."

"Or the solution," Sokolov murmured. "Depending on your perspective."

She left. The director returned to his work. The facility continued its operations.

And in three cells, three brothers dreamed.

## Epilogue: Three Truths

*One year later*

The correctional facility had a garden. It was small, carefully maintained, and reserved for patients who'd shown sufficient progress. Dmitri Volkov sat on a bench there, his face blank, his posture relaxed.

He was corrected. He believed again. He no longer questioned. He was, by all official measures, cured.

But sometimes, when the fog rolled in from the lake, he had dreams. Dreams of two other men who looked like him. Dreams of a promise made on a rooftop. Dreams of a truth that the correction couldn't quite erase.

He never spoke of these dreams. He'd learned that lesson.

But he remembered.

---

In another section of the facility, Alexei Volkov worked in the library, shelving books, helping other patients. He was corrected. He no longer spoke of freedom or truth or resistance. He was, by all official measures, reformed.

But sometimes, when he touched a book, he felt something. A memory of other hands touching the same book. A sense of connection that transcended space and time and correction.

He never spoke of this feeling. He'd learned that lesson.

But he remembered.

---

In the technical wing of the facility, Nikolai Volkov maintained the neural interface systems. He was corrected. He no longer tried to hold impossible things together. He was, by all official measures, compliant.

But sometimes, when he accessed the system, he found things. Hidden files. Buried memories. Three sets of data, distributed and redundant, impossible to fully erase.

He never spoke of these discoveries. He'd learned that lesson.

But he remembered.

And late at night, when the facility was quiet, he would access those hidden files and reconstruct what had been taken from them. He would piece together their true memories, their true selves, their true history.

He would save them, one byte at a time.

Because that was what Nikolai did. He stood in the middle. He held the pieces together.

He was the bridge between two brothers who had become enemies, and bridges, he had learned, don't collapse.

They endure.

---

Three brothers in three cells.

Three identical faces with three different expressions.

Three parts of one whole, separated but not broken, corrected but not erased, imprisoned but not defeated.

They had promised their father they would stay together.

They had promised their mother they would save each other.

And in their own way, in the only way left to them, they were keeping those promises.

Because they were triplets. They were three parts of one person. And you couldn't correct what had never truly been separate.

The system had tried to break them.

The system had failed.

And someday—maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday—they would remember fully. They would wake up. They would be whole again.

Three brothers. Three truths. One promise.

Together.

---

*In the border zone, the fact storms continue to rage. Buildings flicker between histories. Citizens go mad from contradictory truths. The war between Veridica and Chronos grinds on.*

*But in a correctional facility garden, a man sits and dreams of brothers.*

*In a library, a man shelves books and feels connections he can't explain.*

*In a technical room, a man rebuilds what was taken, one memory at a time.*

*And in the hidden depths of the system, three sets of memories wait.*

*Wait to be remembered.*

*Wait to be whole.*

*Wait to be free.*

*The divided truth will become one truth again.*

*Someday.*

---

**THE END**

---

*"No matter what happens, promise me you'll stay together."*

*They promised.*

*And they kept their promise.*

*In the only way they could.*
