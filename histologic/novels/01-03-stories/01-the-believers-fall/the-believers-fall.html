    <meta name="description" content="Marcus Chen is a true believer in his histonation's truth—a Junior Historian who has never questioned a fact in his life. When he meets Elena, a beautiful and intelligent woman who seems to share his values, he falls deeply in love. But Elena is an outlaw recruiter, sent to seduce him into joining the resistance against the histologic system.

When Marcus discovers her deception, he does exactly what the system demands: he reports her, proving his loyalty. But in a world where objective facts matter more than subjective intentions, his eight weeks of contact with an outlaw recruiter marks him as "contaminated." Despite never doubting, despite reporting her, despite his absolute faith, The Judge determines he represents a 73% contamination risk.

Marcus is declared an outlaw and sent to a corrective facility—still believing in the system that condemned him.">

        <!-- Main Content -->
        <main class="story-content">
            <p>Marcus Chen had never questioned a fact in his life, and he was proud of it.</p>

<p>As a Junior Historian for Veridica's Regional Factorepo, he spent his days adding small truths to the great tapestry of history: a traffic accident at the corner of Fifth and Main, a business transaction at the market, a birth at the hospital. Each fact was verified, cross-referenced, and woven into the permanent record. It was honest work. Important work. The kind of work that built a nation on truth rather than lies.</p>

<p>He sat at his workstation on the fourteenth floor, surrounded by the soft hum of data processors and the quiet clicking of his colleagues' keyboards. Three monitors displayed streams of information—sensor feeds, citizen reports, automated logs. His job was to review, verify, and approve facts for entry into the local factorepo. Every fact he added became part of Veridica's history, immutable and eternal.</p>

<p>Marcus adjusted his glasses and reviewed the next item: a minor property dispute between neighbors. The factorepo showed both parties' locations at the time of the alleged incident, their previous interactions, witness statements from automated surveillance. The facts were clear. He approved the entry with a few keystrokes, and the dispute was resolved. The Judge would use this data to determine the outcome. Justice through facts. Perfect and impartial.</p>

<p>"Another day in paradise," Thomas said from the next workstation, stretching his arms above his head.</p>

<p>Marcus smiled. "Someone has to maintain the truth."</p>

<p>"That's what I love about you, Marcus. You actually mean that." Thomas wasn't mocking him—they'd worked together for three years, and Thomas knew Marcus's sincerity was genuine. "Lunch?"</p>

<p>"Can't today. I want to finish this backlog."</p>

<p>Thomas shook his head, grinning. "You're going to die at that desk, and they'll add it to the factorepo: 'Marcus Chen, died doing what he loved—data entry.'"</p>

<p>"There are worse epitaphs."</p>

<p>After Thomas left, Marcus worked through the afternoon, adding facts one by one. Each entry was a small victory against chaos, a brick in the wall of certainty that protected Veridica from the confusion and conflict that plagued other histonations. He'd seen the reports—nations torn apart by disputed facts, wars fought over contradictory histories. Veridica was different. Veridica was true.</p>

<p>At seventeen hundred hours, Marcus logged out and took the elevator down to street level. The capital city spread before him in ordered beauty—clean streets, efficient transport, citizens moving with purpose. Cameras watched from every corner, sensors tracked every movement, and the factorepo recorded it all. Some people found it oppressive, but Marcus found it comforting. In a world where everything was known, nothing could be hidden. In a world where everything was recorded, justice was inevitable.</p>

<p>He walked through the central plaza, as he did most evenings, enjoying the last warmth of the autumn sun. The plaza was a popular gathering spot—fountains, benches, vendor stalls selling approved goods. People met friends, conducted business, lived their lives under the watchful eyes of the surveillance system.</p>

<p>That's when he saw her.</p>

<p>She stood near the fountain, dark hair catching the golden light, wearing a blue dress that somehow seemed both elegant and casual. She was looking at something on her datapad, a slight smile on her face, and Marcus felt his breath catch. He'd seen beautiful women before, of course—beauty was recorded in the factorepo like everything else—but something about her made him stop walking.</p>

<p>She looked up, and their eyes met.</p>

<p>Marcus felt heat rise to his face. He should look away, should keep walking, but he couldn't. She smiled—a genuine, warm smile—and he found himself smiling back.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," she said, walking toward him. "I'm terrible with directions. Could you tell me how to get to the Historical Archives from here?"</p>

<p>Her voice was warm, slightly amused, as if she found her own directional incompetence charming rather than embarrassing.</p>

<p>"Oh, um, yes." Marcus pointed east. "Three blocks that way, then turn left at the Justice Center. You can't miss it—it's the building with the columns."</p>

<p>"Thank you." She tilted her head slightly. "You work there? You seem very certain."</p>

<p>"No, I work at the Regional Factorepo. But I visit the Archives sometimes. For research."</p>

<p>"A historian?" Her smile widened. "That's wonderful. I'm Elena, by the way."</p>

<p>"Marcus. Marcus Chen."</p>

<p>"Well, Marcus Chen, thank you for the directions." She started to leave, then paused. "Actually, would you like to get coffee? I'm new to the area, and it would be nice to talk to someone who knows the city. Unless you're busy—"</p>

<p>"No!" The word came out too quickly, too eagerly. "I mean, yes. I'd like that."</p>

<p>They found a café near the plaza, a small place with outdoor seating where they could watch the evening crowds. Marcus ordered his usual—black coffee, no sugar—and Elena ordered something with milk and cinnamon. They sat across from each other, and Marcus felt acutely aware of the cameras recording them, the sensors logging their locations, the factorepo noting this interaction. In a few hours, this moment would be part of history: Marcus Chen and Elena Reyes, meeting at café, seventeen forty-three hours.</p>

<p>"So," Elena said, wrapping her hands around her cup. "Tell me about being a historian. Is it as exciting as it sounds?"</p>

<p>Marcus laughed. "Most people find it boring."</p>

<p>"Most people are wrong about a lot of things."</p>

<p>They talked for an hour. Elena was a freelance data analyst, she said, recently moved to the capital for work. She was intelligent, asking thoughtful questions about his job, about Veridica, about the factorepo system. She seemed genuinely interested, not just making conversation. When Marcus explained how facts were verified and cross-referenced, she leaned forward, engaged.</p>

<p>"It must be satisfying," she said. "Knowing that what you do creates certainty. In my work, there's always interpretation, always ambiguity. But facts—facts are absolute."</p>

<p>"Exactly." Marcus felt a warmth in his chest. She understood. "That's exactly it."</p>

<p>When they finally parted, Elena touched his arm lightly. "This was lovely. Would you like to do it again? Maybe dinner?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Marcus said, not even pretending to think about it. "I'd like that very much."</p>

<p>He walked home feeling lighter than he had in months. Years, maybe. Since his parents died, he'd thrown himself into work, into service, into the comfortable routines of a believer's life. He had colleagues but few friends, acquaintances but no real connections. He'd told himself he was content, that his work was enough.</p>

<p>But now, walking through the monitored streets with the memory of Elena's smile, he realized how lonely he'd been.</p>

<hr>

<p>They had dinner three days later at a restaurant overlooking the river. Elena wore a green dress that made her eyes seem darker, more mysterious. They talked about everything—their childhoods, their work, their hopes. Marcus told her about his parents, about how their deaths had made him more devoted to Veridica, to the idea that truth and order could protect against chaos.</p>

<p>"They served the system their whole lives," he said. "My father was an enforcer. My mother taught history. They believed in what we're building here."</p>

<p>Elena reached across the table and squeezed his hand. "They'd be proud of you."</p>

<p>Over the next few weeks, they saw each other regularly. Coffee in the mornings before work, dinner in the evenings, walks through the city on weekends. Marcus felt himself falling, and he didn't try to stop it. Elena was everything he'd wanted without knowing he wanted it—intelligent, beautiful, interested in his work, respectful of his beliefs.</p>

<p>She asked questions about the factorepo, about how the system worked, and Marcus enjoyed explaining it. He liked that she wanted to understand, that she took his work seriously.</p>

<p>"So The Judge can access any fact in the system?" she asked one evening as they walked through a park.</p>

<p>"Any fact that's relevant to a case, yes. That's how justice works—complete information, logical analysis, impartial decisions."</p>

<p>"And there's no appeal?"</p>

<p>"Why would there be? The Judge bases decisions on facts. Facts can't be wrong."</p>

<p>Elena was quiet for a moment. "But what if the facts are incomplete? What if something wasn't recorded?"</p>

<p>Marcus shook his head. "Everything is recorded. That's the point. The surveillance system, the sensors, the citizen reports—it all feeds into the factorepo. There are no gaps."</p>

<p>"That must be comforting," Elena said softly. "Knowing everything is known."</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>But something in her tone made him glance at her. She was smiling, but there was something in her eyes he couldn't quite read. Sadness? Doubt? It was gone before he could identify it.</p>

<p>"Come on," she said, squeezing his hand. "Let's get something to eat. I'm starving."</p>

<hr>

<p>Six weeks after they met, Elena invited Marcus to her apartment for dinner. It was a modest place in a quiet neighborhood, tastefully furnished but not extravagant. Marcus noticed immediately that it felt different from other apartments he'd visited—quieter somehow, more private.</p>

<p>"I like it here," Elena said, pouring wine. "It's peaceful."</p>

<p>They ate pasta that Elena had made herself, and Marcus marveled at how comfortable he felt. This was what he'd been missing—not just companionship, but connection. Someone who understood him, who shared his values, who made him feel less alone in the world.</p>

<p>After dinner, they sat on her couch, and Elena leaned against him. Marcus put his arm around her, feeling the warmth of her body, the softness of her hair against his cheek.</p>

<p>"Marcus," she said quietly. "Can I ask you something?"</p>

<p>"Anything."</p>

<p>"Do you ever wonder if there's more to truth than what's in the factorepo?"</p>

<p>The question surprised him. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean..." She sat up, turning to face him. "The factorepo records what happens. But does it record why? Does it record what people feel, what they believe, what they hope for?"</p>

<p>"Those things aren't facts," Marcus said carefully. "They're subjective."</p>

<p>"But they're real. They matter."</p>

<p>"Of course they matter. But they can't be verified. They can't be proven. The factorepo deals with objective truth."</p>

<p>Elena looked at him for a long moment, and again Marcus saw that strange expression in her eyes. "And you've never doubted that? Never wondered if maybe objective truth isn't the whole truth?"</p>

<p>A small alarm went off in Marcus's mind. These were the kinds of questions doubters asked. The kinds of questions that led to correction.</p>

<p>"Elena," he said gently. "Are you... questioning the system?"</p>

<p>She laughed, but it sounded forced. "No, of course not. I'm just curious about how you think about these things. You're so certain, so secure in your beliefs. I admire that."</p>

<p>The alarm faded. She was just curious, just trying to understand his perspective. There was nothing wrong with questions, as long as they didn't lead to doubt.</p>

<p>"I'm certain because the facts are certain," he said. "Everything else is just... noise."</p>

<p>Elena smiled and kissed him. "You're right. I'm sorry. Sometimes I overthink things."</p>

<p>They didn't talk about it again that night. Instead, they talked about simpler things—movies they'd seen, places they wanted to visit, the small details of daily life. When Marcus left, late in the evening, Elena held him at the door.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I met you," she said.</p>

<p>"I'm glad too."</p>

<p>Walking home, Marcus felt a strange unease. Elena's questions had been innocent enough, but they'd touched on something he preferred not to examine too closely. The system worked. Veridica was true. These were facts, as solid as the ground beneath his feet.</p>

<p>But a small part of him wondered why Elena had asked.</p>

<hr>

<p>Over the next two weeks, Elena asked more questions. They were subtle, woven into casual conversations, but Marcus began to notice a pattern. She'd ask about enforcement procedures, about how outlaws were detected, about the correction system. She'd wonder aloud about other histonations, about whether their citizens were happy, about how anyone could know which version of history was really true.</p>

<p>"All histonations believe their factorepo is correct," she said one evening. "But they contradict each other. So either one is right and the others are wrong, or..."</p>

<p>"Or what?" Marcus asked.</p>

<p>"Or maybe truth is more complicated than we think."</p>

<p>"Truth isn't complicated," Marcus said firmly. "It just is. Veridica's factorepo is accurate. Other histonations are wrong. That's why we have conflicts."</p>

<p>"And you're certain of that? Absolutely certain?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Elena looked at him with an expression he couldn't quite read—pity, maybe, or sadness. "I wish I could be that certain about anything."</p>

<p>The unease Marcus had felt before returned, stronger now. These weren't just curious questions. These were the questions of someone who doubted. Someone who questioned the foundation of everything Veridica stood for.</p>

<p>"Elena," he said carefully. "You're not... you don't doubt Veridica's truth, do you?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," she said quickly. Too quickly. "I'm just trying to understand different perspectives. That's all."</p>

<p>But Marcus didn't believe her. Not entirely.</p>

<p>That night, lying in bed, he thought about Elena's questions. He thought about how she'd appeared in his life so suddenly, so perfectly. He thought about her apartment, about how quiet it was, how private. He thought about the way she asked questions—not random curiosity, but targeted, specific inquiries about the system's weaknesses.</p>

<p>No. He was being paranoid. Elena was just curious, just intellectually engaged. There was nothing wrong with questions.</p>

<p>But the doubt, once planted, grew.</p>

<hr>

<p>The next time he visited Elena's apartment, Marcus paid more attention. The quietness that had seemed peaceful now seemed suspicious. Was the surveillance working here? He couldn't see any cameras, couldn't hear the usual hum of sensors. In most apartments, you could feel the presence of the monitoring system—a subtle awareness that you were being watched, being recorded. Here, that feeling was absent.</p>

<p>While Elena was in the kitchen, Marcus looked around more carefully. The apartment was neat, almost impersonal. There were no family photos, no personal mementos, nothing that suggested a history. It was the apartment of someone who'd just moved in—or someone who was hiding.</p>

<p>He opened a drawer in the side table, telling himself he was just curious, just checking. Inside were ordinary things—pens, notepads, charging cables. But underneath, his fingers touched something hard and smooth. He pulled it out.</p>

<p>It was a communication device, but not a standard civilian model. This was something else—compact, encrypted, designed for covert use. The kind of device outlaws used.</p>

<p>Marcus's heart stopped.</p>

<p>"Marcus?"</p>

<p>He turned. Elena stood in the kitchen doorway, holding two glasses of wine. She saw what was in his hand, and her expression changed. The warmth, the affection, the gentle curiosity—all of it vanished, replaced by something cold and calculating.</p>

<p>"You weren't supposed to find that," she said quietly.</p>

<p>Marcus stood, the device still in his hand. "What is this?"</p>

<p>"You know what it is."</p>

<p>"No." He shook his head. "No, this is a mistake. This is someone else's. You're holding it for a friend, or—"</p>

<p>"Marcus." Elena set down the wine glasses. "I'm an outlaw."</p>

<p>The words hit him like a physical blow. "No."</p>

<p>"I was sent here to recruit you. To turn you against Veridica, to bring you to the resistance." She spoke calmly, matter-of-factly, as if discussing the weather. "You were a perfect target—lonely, idealistic, trusting. It should have been easy."</p>

<p>Marcus felt the room spinning. "You're lying. This is some kind of test—"</p>

<p>"It's not a test. Everything between us has been a lie. The questions, the interest in your work, the—" She gestured vaguely. "All of it. I was doing my job."</p>

<p>"Your job." Marcus's voice sounded strange to his own ears. "Your job was to seduce me?"</p>

<p>"My job was to recruit you. Seduction is just a tool."</p>

<p>He looked at her—this woman he'd thought he loved, this woman he'd imagined a future with—and saw a stranger. "Why are you telling me this?"</p>

<p>"Because you found the device. Because the mission is compromised." Elena crossed her arms. "And because I'm going to give you a choice."</p>

<p>"A choice."</p>

<p>"You can report me. Turn me in to the enforcers, prove your loyalty to Veridica. They'll arrest me, probably correct me, and you'll go back to your life." She paused. "Or you can listen to what I have to say. Really listen. And then decide."</p>

<p>Marcus's mind raced. He should leave. He should call the enforcers immediately. This was exactly what he'd been trained to do—report outlaws, protect the system, maintain the truth.</p>

<p>But he didn't move.</p>

<p>"Why me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because you're a historian. Because you have access to the factorepo. Because you're exactly the kind of true believer who, if turned, would be valuable to the resistance." Elena's voice was cold, clinical. "And because you were lonely. Lonely people are easier to manipulate."</p>

<p>The cruelty of it took his breath away. "You never cared about me at all."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Everything was fake."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Marcus felt something break inside him. Not his faith in Veridica—that remained solid, unshakeable. But something else, something softer and more fragile. The hope that he could be loved. The belief that he could be seen as more than just a tool, a target, a means to an end.</p>

<p>"I'm going to report you," he said quietly.</p>

<p>Elena nodded. "I expected that. You're a true believer, Marcus. That's what makes you valuable, and that's what makes you useless to us. You'll never question, never doubt, never see beyond the facts you're fed."</p>

<p>"The facts aren't 'fed' to me. They're verified. They're true."</p>

<p>"Are they?" For the first time, emotion crept into Elena's voice—not affection, but something harder. Anger, maybe. "Did you verify the facts about my brother? About what they did to him in correction?"</p>

<p>"Your brother?"</p>

<p>"He questioned a minor discrepancy in the factorepo. Nothing major, just a small contradiction he noticed. They detected his doubt, arrested him, sent him to correction." Her voice shook. "When he came back, he wasn't my brother anymore. He was empty. Broken. They didn't correct his thinking—they destroyed his mind."</p>

<p>Marcus shook his head. "Correction is therapeutic. It helps people—"</p>

<p>"It's torture, Marcus. Psychological destruction dressed up as mercy. And you support it. You enable it. You add facts to the system that condemns people like my brother."</p>

<p>"Your brother was sick. Doubt is a mental illness—"</p>

<p>"Doubt is human!" Elena's composure cracked. "Questioning is human! The system you worship treats humanity as a disease to be cured!"</p>

<p>"The system protects us from chaos!"</p>

<p>"The system is the chaos! Can't you see that? Veridica's truth contradicts other histonations' truths. Wars are fought over disputed facts. People are tortured for asking questions. And you call that order?"</p>

<p>Marcus backed toward the door. "You're the sick one. You're the one who needs correction."</p>

<p>"Maybe I do." Elena's voice went cold again. "But at least I'm still human. At least I can still think for myself."</p>

<p>"I'm calling the enforcers."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>Marcus reached for his comm device, but Elena didn't try to stop him. She just stood there, watching him with those dark eyes that had once seemed warm and were now just empty.</p>

<p>"They'll catch me," she said. "I won't run. There's no point. But Marcus—when they come for you too, remember this conversation."</p>

<p>"They won't come for me. I'm reporting you. I'm proving my loyalty."</p>

<p>Elena smiled, and it was the saddest thing Marcus had ever seen. "You still don't understand. In a system of absolute facts, contact with an outlaw is contamination. It doesn't matter that you're reporting me. It doesn't matter that you never doubted. The facts will show eight weeks of interaction with a known recruiter. The Judge will calculate your probability of compromise. And the numbers won't care about your loyalty."</p>

<p>"That's not how it works—"</p>

<p>"That's exactly how it works. I've seen it before. Good citizens, loyal believers, people who reported outlaws just like you're reporting me. And the system condemned them anyway, because the facts showed exposure. Because statistics don't care about intentions."</p>

<p>Marcus's hand trembled on his comm device. "You're lying. You're trying to manipulate me again."</p>

<p>"I'm telling you the truth. Finally." Elena sat down on the couch, suddenly looking exhausted. "Make your call, Marcus. Do your duty. But don't be surprised when duty isn't enough."</p>

<p>Marcus activated his comm and requested an enforcer connection. His voice was steady as he gave his report: suspected outlaw, location, evidence. The enforcer on the other end asked if he was in danger. Marcus said no. They said someone would be there in ten minutes.</p>

<p>He ended the call and looked at Elena. She hadn't moved.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you run?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because I'm tired. Because I've recruited seven people, and I'm not sure anymore if I saved them or destroyed them. Because maybe correction is what I deserve." She looked up at him. "And because I wanted you to see what happens next. I wanted you to understand."</p>

<p>"I understand that you're a criminal."</p>

<p>"No, Marcus. You don't understand anything."</p>

<p>They sat in silence until the enforcers arrived. Two of them, professional and efficient. They verified Marcus's identity, confirmed his report, and placed Elena under arrest. She didn't resist. As they led her to the door, she looked back at Marcus one last time.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said. "Not for the mission. But for making you think you were loved. That was cruel."</p>

<p>Then she was gone, and Marcus was alone in the apartment with one remaining enforcer—a senior officer named Kade.</p>

<p>"You did the right thing, Mr. Chen," Kade said. "Reporting outlaws is every citizen's duty."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"We'll need you to come to the Enforcement Center tomorrow to give a full statement. Just a formality."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>Kade studied him for a moment. "How long had you known the suspect?"</p>

<p>"Eight weeks. Since we met in the central plaza."</p>

<p>"And you had no suspicions before tonight?"</p>

<p>"No. She seemed like a normal citizen."</p>

<p>"That's what makes them dangerous." Kade made a note on his datapad. "We'll need to review your factorepo record, verify the timeline of your interactions. Standard procedure."</p>

<p>Something in Marcus's chest tightened. "I understand."</p>

<p>"Good. We'll see you tomorrow at oh-nine-hundred hours."</p>

<p>After Kade left, Marcus stood in Elena's apartment—the outlaw's apartment—and felt numb. He'd done the right thing. He'd protected Veridica. He'd proven his loyalty.</p>

<p>So why did he feel like he'd just made a terrible mistake?</p>

<hr>

<p>Marcus didn't sleep that night. He lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, replaying every conversation with Elena. Had there been signs? Had he been blind? Or had she been that good at deception?</p>

<p>The worst part was that he'd believed she cared about him. He'd thought he'd found something real, something genuine. But it had all been a performance, a calculated manipulation. She'd studied him, identified his weaknesses, and exploited them with surgical precision.</p>

<p>He felt like a fool.</p>

<p>At oh-nine-hundred hours, Marcus presented himself at the Enforcement Center. Kade met him in a small interview room—white walls, a table, two chairs, and a camera recording everything.</p>

<p>"Thank you for coming, Mr. Chen," Kade said, sitting across from him. "This shouldn't take long."</p>

<p>"I'm happy to help."</p>

<p>Kade pulled up a display on the table's surface. "I've reviewed your factorepo record. You met Elena Vasquez—that's her real name, by the way, not Reyes—eight weeks ago in the central plaza. You had forty-seven recorded interactions after that. Coffee meetings, dinners, walks, visits to her apartment. Is that accurate?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And during these interactions, did she ask questions about the factorepo system?"</p>

<p>Marcus hesitated. "Yes. But I thought she was just curious. I thought she wanted to understand my work."</p>

<p>"What kind of questions?"</p>

<p>"How facts are verified. How The Judge accesses information. How enforcement works. How correction—" Marcus stopped. "She was gathering intelligence."</p>

<p>"Yes. Elena Vasquez is a trained recruiter. She's successfully turned seven citizens over the past two years. You would have been the eighth."</p>

<p>"But I reported her. I didn't turn."</p>

<p>"No, you didn't." Kade studied him. "Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I believe in Veridica. Because I believe in the truth."</p>

<p>"Even though you had feelings for her?"</p>

<p>"My feelings don't change the facts."</p>

<p>Kade nodded slowly. "That's good, Mr. Chen. That's exactly the right answer." He made another note. "However, we have a problem."</p>

<p>The tightness in Marcus's chest returned. "What problem?"</p>

<p>"You had eight weeks of sustained contact with a known outlaw recruiter. Forty-seven recorded interactions. One hundred twenty-seven hours of conversation. Three visits to her apartment, which we now know was equipped with surveillance blockers." Kade looked at him. "The Judge has analyzed your factorepo record and calculated a contamination probability."</p>

<p>"Contamination?"</p>

<p>"The likelihood that you've been compromised. That despite reporting her, you've been influenced by outlaw ideology. That you represent a risk to Veridica's security."</p>

<p>Marcus felt cold. "But I reported her. I proved my loyalty."</p>

<p>"Loyalty isn't the question, Mr. Chen. Exposure is." Kade's voice was matter-of-fact, not unkind. "The Judge's analysis shows a seventy-three percent probability that you've been contaminated by prolonged contact with an outlaw recruiter. In Veridica, anything over sixty percent requires corrective intervention."</p>

<p>"No." The word came out as a whisper. "No, I'm not contaminated. I never doubted. I never questioned. I believe—"</p>

<p>"Your belief isn't measurable, Mr. Chen. Your exposure is." Kade stood. "I'm sorry, but The Judge's determination is final. You're being classified as a compromised citizen and remanded to corrective custody."</p>

<p>"This is wrong. The Judge is wrong."</p>

<p>"The Judge cannot be wrong. The facts are the facts."</p>

<p>"But I'm loyal! I reported her! I did everything right!"</p>

<p>"And that's been noted in your record. It may reduce your correction time." Kade gestured to the door. "Please come with me."</p>

<p>Marcus wanted to run, wanted to fight, wanted to scream that this was insane, that he'd done nothing wrong. But he didn't. Because running would prove their suspicions. Fighting would confirm their fears. And screaming wouldn't change the facts.</p>

<p>The facts were the facts.</p>

<p>He followed Kade through the Enforcement Center, down corridors he'd never seen, to a processing area where other citizens waited—some confused, some angry, some resigned. They were all contaminated, all compromised, all guilty of the crime of exposure.</p>

<p>A woman in a white coat approached him. "Mr. Chen? I'm Dr. Reyna Moss. I'll be overseeing your correction."</p>

<p>"I don't need correction," Marcus said. "I'm not sick."</p>

<p>"The Judge has determined otherwise." Dr. Moss's voice was kind but firm. "Correction isn't punishment, Mr. Chen. It's healing. We're going to help you."</p>

<p>"Help me believe? I already believe!"</p>

<p>"The facts suggest otherwise."</p>

<p>They processed him like cargo—took his citizen ID, his comm device, his personal effects. They gave him a gray uniform and led him to a small room with white walls, a bed, and monitoring equipment. A correction chamber.</p>

<p>"The process will begin tomorrow," Dr. Moss said. "For now, try to rest. Everything is going to be all right."</p>

<p>But everything wasn't all right. Everything was wrong. Marcus had done exactly what the system asked of him. He'd reported the outlaw. He'd proven his loyalty. He'd never doubted, never questioned, never wavered in his faith.</p>

<p>And the system had condemned him anyway.</p>

<p>He sat on the bed, alone in the white room, and thought about Elena's last words: "When they come for you too, remember this conversation."</p>

<p>She'd known. She'd known this would happen. She'd tried to warn him, and he hadn't listened.</p>

<p>But even now, even sitting in a correction chamber awaiting psychological intervention, Marcus couldn't bring himself to doubt Veridica's truth. The factorepo was accurate. The Judge was logical. The system was just.</p>

<p>It had to be.</p>

<p>Because if it wasn't—if Elena had been right, if the system could condemn the innocent, if loyalty meant nothing when the facts said otherwise—then everything Marcus believed, everything his parents had believed, everything he'd built his life around was a lie.</p>

<p>And that was impossible.</p>

<p>The facts were the facts.</p>

<hr>

<p>The door opened, and Dr. Moss returned with her gentle smile and her instruments of mercy. Marcus closed his eyes and whispered to himself, to no one, to the empty air: "I believe. I believe. I believe."</p>

<p>But the facts said otherwise, and the facts were all that mattered.</p>

                <div class="footer-content">
                    Marcus Chen is a true believer in his histonation's truth—a Junior Historian who has never questioned a fact in his life. When he meets Elena, a beautiful and intelligent woman who seems to share his values, he falls deeply in love. But Elena is an outlaw recruiter, sent to seduce him into joining the resistance against the histologic system.

When Marcus discovers her deception, he does exactly what the system demands: he reports her, proving his loyalty. But in a world where objective facts matter more than subjective intentions, his eight weeks of contact with an outlaw recruiter marks him as "contaminated." Despite never doubting, despite reporting her, despite his absolute faith, The Judge determines he represents a 73% contamination risk.

Marcus is declared an outlaw and sent to a corrective facility—still believing in the system that condemned him.
