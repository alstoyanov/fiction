## Writing Guidelines

### POV and Voice

**Third-Person Limited**:
- Stay in one character's head per chapter
- Show only what that character knows/experiences
- Use their voice and perspective
- Rotate POVs to show different angles

**Character Voices**:
- **Marcus**: Analytical, idealistic, questioning
- **Kira**: Precise, pragmatic, sharp observations
- **Dmitri**: Rigid, passionate, protective
- **Alexei**: Charismatic, rebellious, humorous
- **Nikolai**: Anxious, brilliant, mediating
- **Dr. Yuki Tanaka**: Gentle, wise, compassionate
- **Isaiah**: Eloquent, observant, documenting
- **Mikhail "Old Songs"**: Musical, cryptic, profound
- **Elena**: Pragmatic, ruthless, strategic

### Pacing

**Chapter Length**: 3,500-4,500 words
- Action scenes: 3,000-3,500 words (faster pacing)
- Emotional scenes: 4,000-5,000 words (deeper exploration)
- Revelation scenes: 4,500-5,500 words (build tension)

**Scene Structure**:
1. **Opening**: Hook, establish POV/setting (300-500 words)
2. **Development**: Main action/dialogue (2,500-3,500 words)
3. **Climax**: Chapter's peak moment (500-700 words)
4. **Closing**: Resolution + hook for next (200-300 words)

### Dialogue

**Natural Flow**:
- People interrupt each other
- Sentences trail off
- Subtext matters more than text
- Action beats between dialogue

**Character-Specific**:
- **Marcus**: Formal, precise, quotes facts
- **Kira**: Short sentences, technical terms
- **Alexei**: Casual, jokes, challenges
- **Mikhail**: Songs, riddles, old quotes
- **Dr. Tanaka**: Medical metaphors, gentle
- **Isaiah**: Historical references, eloquent

**Wise Speakers** (use sparingly for impact):
- **Dr. Tanaka**: "A wound must be acknowledged before it can heal"
- **Isaiah**: "History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes"
- **Mikhail**: Sings songs, gives riddles, quotes old wisdom

### Description

**Show, Don't Tell**:
- ❌ "Marcus was angry"
- ✅ "Marcus's hands clenched into fists"

**Sensory Details**:
- What does it look/sound/smell/feel/taste like?
- Use specific, concrete details
- Avoid generic descriptions

**Steampunk Aesthetic**:
- Brass fixtures, copper lanterns
- Mechanical precision
- Victorian-era meets high-tech
- Gears, clockwork, steam

### Themes Integration

**Primary Themes** (weave throughout):
- Truth vs. Certainty
- System vs. Humanity
- Belief vs. Evidence
- Love vs. Duty

**Show themes through**:
- Character choices
- Dialogue debates
- Plot consequences
- Symbolic moments
