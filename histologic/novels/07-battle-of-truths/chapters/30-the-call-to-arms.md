# Chapter 30: The Call to Arms

**Date**: June 2110  
**Location**: Veridica, Marcus and Kira's apartment

---

Marcus Chen sat in his apartment, staring at the summons from Chancellor Petrov. He'd been expecting it. Dreading it. Knowing it was coming.

The fact war was over. SFW was preparing to invade. And Veridica needed him again.

Needed him to become something new. Something worse.

He'd been a believer. A reformer. A revolutionary. A spy.

Now they wanted him to be a soldier.

Kira sat beside him, holding her own summons. They'd both been called. Both been asked to serve. Both been told their nation needed them.

"Are you going to accept?" Kira asked.

"I don't know. Are you?"

"I don't want to. I want to go back to being a historian, researching truth, not fighting wars. But I don't think that's an option anymore."

Marcus looked at the summons again. **STRATEGIC DEFENSE COORDINATOR**. A position that would put him at the center of Veridica's defense. A position that would require him to plan operations, coordinate strategies, make decisions that would cost lives.

"We could refuse," Marcus said. "We could walk away. Let someone else fight."

"Could we? Could we really watch Veridica face invasion and do nothing?"

"No. I don't think we could."

They sat in silence, both knowing they were going to say yes, both wishing they could say no.

Marcus arrived at the Government Complex at 09:00. Chancellor Petrov, General Sokolov, and the defense council were waiting.

"Marcus, thank you for coming," Petrov said. "We need you."

"For what?"

"SFW is preparing to invade. Within a year, possibly sooner. We need to prepare our defenses. And we need someone who understands both Histologic and non-Histologic thinking. Someone who can think strategically, unconventionally, creatively."

"I'm not a soldier."

General Sokolov spoke: "No. But you're a strategist. You understand information warfare, psychological operations, intelligence gathering. You ended the fact war through strategy, not violence. We need that."

"I'm done with covert operations. I'm done with deception."

"This won't be covert," Petrov said. "This will be open war. Defense of our nation, our people, our way of life. No deception. No infiltration. Just defense."

"Our way of life that I just proved is corruptible?"

"Yes. That one. Flawed, vulnerable, imperfect. But ours. And worth defending."

Marcus thought about that. The system he'd corrupted. The principles he'd betrayed. The nation he'd saved by becoming what he'd fought against.

Was it worth defending?

"Marcus," Petrov said quietly. "I know what you're thinking. You're wondering if a corrupted system deserves defense. If a nation that won through deception deserves survival. If people who became monsters deserve protection."

"Yes. That's exactly what I'm thinking."

"And I don't have a good answer. Except this: the people of Veridica didn't corrupt the system. We did. The civilians didn't betray principles. We did. The families, the children, the ordinary people living their lives—they're innocent."

"And they're the ones who'll die if SFW invades."

"Yes."

Marcus was quiet for a long time. "What would you need me to do?"

"Coordinate strategic defense. Work with General Sokolov. Plan operations. Analyze SFW tactics. Find vulnerabilities. Help us survive."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then someone else will do it. Someone less capable. Someone who might fail. And Veridica might fall. And that would be on both of us."

Marcus thought: *I became a reformer to fix the system. I became a spy to save the system. Now I'm being asked to become a soldier to defend the system. Where does it end?*

Petrov answered as if reading his mind: "It ends when we're safe. Or when we're dead. Those are the only endings in war."

Marcus returned home to discuss it with Kira. She'd been offered a similar position—technical intelligence, defensive systems, counter-infiltration.

"Are you going to accept?" Marcus asked.

"I don't want to. But I don't think I have a choice."

"We always have a choice."

"Do we? Can we really watch Veridica face invasion and do nothing? Can we live with ourselves if we refuse to help and people die?"

"No. We can't."

"Then we don't have a choice. We have an obligation."

They sat together on their couch, the same couch where they'd sat after the Chronos operation, carrying guilt and wondering if they'd been right.

Now they were facing another impossible choice. Another terrible decision. Another transformation into something they didn't want to be.

"I'm tired," Kira said quietly. "I'm tired of fighting. Tired of making impossible choices. Tired of becoming things I hate. I just want to be a historian again. I just want to research truth without weaponizing it."

"I know. So do I."

"But we can't."

"No. We can't."

Kira leaned against him. "Marcus, do you ever wonder if we're cursed? If we're doomed to keep fighting forever? If we'll ever find peace?"

"Every day."

"And?"

"And I don't know. Maybe we are cursed. Maybe this is just our life now. Fighting. Transforming. Becoming worse versions of ourselves. Maybe that's all we get."

"That's a terrible answer."

"Yes. It is."

---

Marcus thought about his journey. The path that had led here.

Started as a true believer in the system. Thought The Judge was objective, that verification was truth, that the system worked.

Became a reformer when he saw corruption. Fought for transparency, accountability, distributed truth.

Became a revolutionary when reform failed. Joined the resistance, challenged power, advocated for change.

Became a spy when revolution required it. Infiltrated Chronos, corrupted their systems, won through deception.

Now becoming a soldier when invasion threatened. Defending what he'd corrupted. Fighting for what he'd betrayed.

Each step had seemed necessary. Each step had led further from who he wanted to be.

Where did it end?

He thought about Foundation Principle Seven—the one he'd discovered in "The Lost Hour": *The system perpetuates through controlled opposition. Those who fight it become part of it. Resistance is absorbed. Revolution is managed. Change is illusory.*

He'd fought the system. Become part of it. Been absorbed by it. Managed by it.

He'd thought he was choosing his path. But maybe the path had been choosing him all along.

Maybe the Foundation had anticipated people like him. Reformers who'd become revolutionaries. Revolutionaries who'd become spies. Spies who'd become soldiers.

Maybe he'd never been free. Maybe none of them had.

Maybe they were all just performing roles in a script written decades ago.

That evening, Marcus visited Mikhail "Old Songs" Petrov one last time before accepting the position.

"I'm going to say yes," Marcus told him. "I'm going to help defend Veridica. I'm going to become a soldier."

"And how do you feel about that?"

"Trapped. Like I'm following a script I can't escape. Like every choice I make leads me further from who I want to be."

Mikhail nodded slowly. "You want me to tell you that you're wrong. That you're free. That your choices matter."

"Yes."

"I can't. Because I don't know if that's true." Mikhail poured tea. "Marcus, I've been fighting for sixty years. I've made every choice you've made. Believer to reformer to revolutionary. And I still don't know if I was free or just following a pattern."

"That's not comforting."

"No. It's not. But it's honest." Mikhail sipped his tea. "Here's what I know: you can't escape the system. You can only choose how you engage with it. You can fight openly or covertly. You can resist or collaborate. You can maintain principles or compromise them. But you can't escape."

"So we're all trapped."

"Yes. But trapped people can still choose how they act within their cage. That's not freedom. But it's something."

Mikhail began to sing, his voice cracked but still carrying:

*"You've got to know when to hold 'em  
Know when to fold 'em  
Know when to walk away  
Know when to run"*

"'The Gambler,'" Marcus said. "Kenny Rogers."

"Yes. It's about making choices with incomplete information. About knowing when to fight and when to retreat. About accepting that you can't control everything."

"Which should I do now? Hold or fold?"

"Hold. Because folding means watching Veridica fall. And I don't think you can live with that."

"Even though the system is corrupt? Even though we proved it's vulnerable? Even though we became what we fought against?"

"Yes. Even though all of that. Because the alternative is worse."

---

Marcus accepted the position. Kira accepted hers. They reported to Military Intelligence headquarters the next day, ready to begin preparing for war.

General Sokolov briefed them on the situation. SFW's mobilization. Chronos's reluctant alliance. The defensive positions being prepared. The timeline: six months, maybe less.

"We're outnumbered," Sokolov said. "We're divided. We're guilty. We're fractured. But we're also desperate. And desperate people fight harder than confident ones."

"Is that enough to win?" Marcus asked.

"I don't know. But it's enough to fight. And sometimes fighting is all we can do."

Marcus and Kira began their work. Strategic planning. Intelligence analysis. Defensive coordination. The same skills they'd used to win the fact war, now applied to defending against invasion.

It felt different. Cleaner, somehow. They weren't deceiving anyone. Weren't infiltrating. Weren't corrupting. Just defending.

But it also felt like continuation. Another war. Another transformation. Another step further from who they'd wanted to be.

---

One evening, Marcus stood at the window of the command center, looking out at Veridica. The city was mobilizing. Troops moving to the border. Civilians preparing for potential conflict. Reality shifting from peace to war.

Kira joined him. "Do you think we can win?"

"I don't know. Maybe. If we're lucky. If we're smart. If we're willing to do what's necessary."

"We're always willing to do what's necessary. That's our problem."

"Yes. It is."

They stood together, watching their nation prepare for war. The nation they'd saved by corrupting it. The nation they'd defend by fighting for it. The nation that had transformed them from believers to reformers to revolutionaries to spies to soldiers.

Marcus thought: *This is my life now. Fighting. Transforming. Becoming worse. Never escaping. Never finding peace.*

*But maybe that's okay. Maybe some people are meant to fight. Maybe some people are meant to carry the weight. Maybe some people are meant to become monsters so others don't have to.*

*Maybe that's me.*

*Maybe that's all I ever was.*

He turned to Kira. "Are you ready for this?"

"No. But I'll do it anyway."

"Why?"

"Because someone has to. Because the alternative is worse. Because I can't watch Veridica fall and do nothing."

"Even though we corrupted it?"

"Yes. Even though we corrupted it. Because corruption doesn't mean it's not worth saving. It just means it's flawed. And flawed things can still be worth fighting for."

Marcus nodded. "Then let's fight."

They returned to their work. Planning. Strategizing. Preparing. Becoming soldiers.

Becoming the next version of themselves.

Becoming what the war required.

Outside, Veridica prepared for invasion. Inside, two people who'd already lost themselves prepared to lose more.

The fact war was over.

The blood war was coming.

And they'd fight.

Because that's what they did.

Because that's who they'd become.

Because they had no choice.

Or maybe they did have a choice, and they'd already made it.

Maybe they'd made it years ago, when they'd chosen to fight instead of accept.

Maybe they'd made it when they'd become reformers.

Or revolutionaries.

Or spies.

Maybe every choice had led here. To this moment. To this war. To this transformation.

Maybe they'd never been free.

Or maybe freedom was just another word for choosing your cage.

Marcus didn't know.

But he knew this: he'd fight. He'd defend. He'd become whatever he needed to become.

Because Veridica needed defending.

Because people needed protecting.

Because the alternative was worse.

And because he'd already crossed every line there was to cross.

What was one more?
