# Chapter 25: The Guilt

**Date**: January 2110 (weeks after victory)  
**Location**: Veridica, Marcus and Kira's apartment

---

Marcus Chen sat in his apartment at 03:00, staring at nothing. He'd been sitting there for two hours. Hadn't moved. Hadn't slept. Just sat in the darkness, carrying the weight.

The fact war was over. Veridica was safe. The border zones were stabilizing. Civilian casualties were declining. Families were reuniting. Reality was stable again.

They'd won.

And Marcus was drowning in guilt.

He heard Kira moving in the bedroom. Footsteps. Then she appeared in the doorway, wearing one of his shirts, looking as exhausted as he felt.

"You're not sleeping," she said.

"Neither are you."

She sat beside him on the couch. They didn't touch. Just sat together in the darkness, two people who'd committed a crime against truth and were living with the consequences.

"I keep thinking about what we did," Kira said. "About Julian. About the fact that we're celebrated for something we should be ashamed of."

"Are you ashamed?"

"Yes. Aren't you?"

Marcus thought about it honestly. "I don't know. I'm something. Guilt, shame, regret. But also... relief? The fact war is over. Civilians aren't suffering. We achieved what we set out to do."

"By becoming what we fought against."

"Yes."

They sat in silence. Outside, Veridica slept peacefully. Inside, two people who'd saved their nation couldn't sleep at all.

"If you could go back," Kira asked, "would you do it differently?"

Marcus thought about it. Really thought about it. "No. I'd do the same thing. Because the alternative was watching more people suffer. Watching the fact war escalate. Watching reality fracture further. But I'd feel just as guilty about it."

"So we're trapped. We did the only thing we could do, and we hate ourselves for it."

"Yes. That's exactly where we are."

---

Marcus went through the motions during the day. Work at the Historical Integrity Commission. Meetings about factorepo security. Public appearances as a reformer. Everyone thought he was a hero—the man who'd helped end the fact war through diplomatic efforts.

Only he knew the truth.

He reviewed reports from the border zones: psychological casualties declining 40%. Family reunification rate up 67%. Reality Fracture Syndrome diagnoses down 52%. The fact war's end was saving lives, preventing suffering, restoring normalcy.

Numbers. Statistics. Evidence that they'd done the right thing.

He thought: *We did this. We ended the suffering. That's good, right?*

But he couldn't convince himself.

Because he also saw the other numbers. The ones that didn't appear in official reports:

- One good man destroyed
- One nation's history stolen
- One principle betrayed
- One trust weaponized
- One love corrupted

Those numbers didn't decline. They just sat there, permanent, unchanging. The cost of victory.

At work, Marcus was praised. Chancellor Petrov commended his "diplomatic efforts." Colleagues congratulated him on ending the fact war. Citizens thanked him for restoring peace.

He smiled. Accepted the praise. Played the role of hero.

And inside, he felt like a fraud.

During a meeting about factorepo security improvements, someone suggested implementing stronger backup verification protocols. "To prevent what happened to Chronos from happening to us."

Everyone nodded. Good idea. Important safeguard.

Marcus wanted to laugh. Wanted to tell them: *I know exactly how to prevent it. Because I'm the one who did it to them.*

But he stayed silent. Nodded along. Approved the protocols.

And hated himself a little more.

One evening, Marcus visited Mikhail "Old Songs" Petrov. The old man was in his apartment, surrounded by books and music, looking every one of his eighty-one years.

"Marcus," Mikhail said. "I was wondering when you'd come."

"You knew I would?"

"You're carrying something heavy. I can see it. And heavy things need to be shared or they crush you."

They sat together. Mikhail poured tea—not vodka, tea. The kind of drink for long conversations, not quick escapes.

"We did it," Marcus said. "We ended the fact war. Just like we planned."

"And?"

"And I don't know how to live with it."

Mikhail was quiet for a long time. Then he began to sing, his voice cracked but still carrying the melody:

*"That's me in the corner  
That's me in the spotlight  
Losing my religion"*

"'Losing My Religion,'" Marcus said. "R.E.M."

"Yes. It's about losing certainty. Losing faith. Realizing that everything you believed might be wrong." Mikhail set down his tea. "That's where you are, isn't it? You've lost your religion."

"I believed in principles, Mikhail. I believed that truth mattered, that transparency was essential, that corruption was wrong. Those beliefs guided my entire life—from true believer to reformer to revolutionary."

"And now?"

"Now I've proven those principles have limits. Sometimes truth has to be corrupted. Sometimes transparency has to be abandoned. Sometimes corruption is necessary."

"Does that mean you were wrong before? Or wrong now?"

"I don't know. Maybe both. Maybe neither. Maybe everyone's wrong, and there are no right answers."

Mikhail nodded slowly. "I told Nikolai the same thing before he triggered the factorepo failure. Maybe there are no right answers. Maybe there are only choices, and we live with the consequences."

"How do you live with them? You've been fighting for sixty years. You've made compromises. You've done things you regretted. How do you carry it?"

"By remembering why. By not pretending it was noble. By accepting that I'm not a hero—just a man who made choices and has to live with them." Mikhail looked at Marcus with tired eyes. "You want absolution. I can't give you that. You want me to say you did the right thing. I can't say that either. All I can say is: you made a choice, and now you carry it. That's all any of us can do."

"That's not enough."

"No. It's not. But it's all we have."

Late one night, Marcus received an encrypted message. Anonymous. Routed through multiple proxies. Untraceable.

*Marcus Chen—*

*I know what you did. I know you replaced our backup. I know you used Adrian. I know you stole our history.*

*I can't prove it. Not yet. But I'm building a case. Documenting discrepancies. Gathering evidence.*

*Someday, I'll prove it. And then the world will know what you are.*

*Not a hero. A criminal. A spy. A man who corrupted truth itself for strategic advantage.*

*I hope you're proud of your victory. I hope it was worth destroying a good man. I hope you can live with what you've done.*

*Because I have to live with it too.*

*—Julian Kovač*

Marcus stared at the message for a long time. Then he typed a response:

*Julian—*

*You're right. About all of it. I did what you said. I destroyed you. I stole your nation's history. I corrupted truth itself.*

*I'm not proud. It wasn't worth it. And I don't know if I can live with it.*

*But I did it anyway. Because civilians were suffering. Because the fact war was destroying real people. Because I didn't see another way.*

*That's not justification. That's just explanation.*

*I'm sorry. I know that's not enough. I know it doesn't fix anything. But I'm sorry.*

*Build your case. Prove what I did. Expose me. Maybe that's what I deserve.*

*Maybe that's the only way this ends.*

*—Marcus*

He sent the message, knowing it might be the stupidest thing he'd ever done. Knowing it might give Julian the evidence he needed. Knowing it might destroy everything.

But he needed to say it. Needed Julian to know that he wasn't proud, wasn't celebrating, wasn't pretending this was noble.

Needed Julian to know that the guilt was real.

Kira found the message exchange. She was furious.

"Are you insane? You just confessed to espionage! If that message is intercepted, if Julian uses it as evidence, you'll be arrested!"

"I know."

"Then why did you send it?"

"Because he deserved to know. Because I needed to say it. Because carrying this guilt alone was crushing me."

"So you risked everything—the operation, the team, Veridica's security—to ease your conscience?"

"Yes."

Kira stared at him. Then, unexpectedly, she laughed. "You're an idiot."

"I know."

"But you're an honest idiot. And maybe that's worth something."

She sat beside him, took his hand. "Marcus, we did something terrible. We're going to carry it forever. But we can't let the guilt destroy us. We can't let it make us reckless. We have to live with it, carry it, and still function. Because if we fall apart, then what we did was for nothing."

"How do we do that?"

"I don't know. But we figure it out together."

---

Weeks passed. Marcus went through the motions. Work. Meetings. Public appearances. Carrying the guilt. Living with the weight.

He implemented the reforms he'd promised Petrov. Transparency measures. Accountability protocols. Safeguards to prevent future operations like the one they'd executed.

He thought: *I'm trying to make sure no one else becomes what I became. Trying to close the door I walked through. Trying to be better than what I did.*

He didn't know if it was enough.

Didn't know if anything could be enough.

Just knew he had to try.

Because if he didn't, then he really would be the monster Julian thought he was.

---

One night, Marcus stood at his window, looking out at Veridica. The city was peaceful. Stable. The fact war was over. Reality was certain again.

He'd done that. He'd saved this city, these people, this nation.

By becoming what he'd fought against.

By proving that principles were luxuries and pragmatism was survival.

By destroying a good man who'd trusted him.

He thought about the Marcus Chen who'd refused the seduction operation six months ago. The one who'd chosen principles over pragmatism. The one who'd saved Julian by refusing to corrupt.

That Marcus was gone. Replaced by someone who calculated costs and benefits, who weighed harms, who chose corruption when necessary.

Replaced by someone who could live with guilt but couldn't escape it.

Marcus turned away from the window, back to his apartment. Kira was asleep in the bedroom. The city was quiet. The guilt remained.

He thought: *This is my life now. Carrying this weight. Living with this knowledge. Being celebrated for something I'm ashamed of.*

*This is what victory feels like.*

*This is what it costs to save people by becoming a monster.*

*This is the price of pragmatism.*

And he would pay it. Every day. For the rest of his life.

Because someone had to.

Because the alternative was worse.

Because he'd made a choice, and now he had to live with it.

Even if living with it felt like dying slowly.
