# Chapter 7: The Target

**Date**: Early November 2109  
**Location**: Veridica, Intelligence briefing room

---

The briefing room was windowless, shielded from electronic surveillance, accessible only through biometric verification. Elena Volkov sat alone at the table, three dossiers spread before her. Somewhere in these files was the person she would seduce, betray, and destroy.

She'd done this before. During the resistance years, when survival required using every weapon available. She'd seduced security officials, extracted information, disappeared before they realized they'd been compromised. It was a skill. A tool. Nothing personal.

But this felt different. These weren't corrupt officials or system enforcers. These were historians. Scholars. People whose only crime was working for the wrong nation.

Elena opened the first dossier.

**Director Chen Wei, 45, Chronos Security**

High-level access. Paranoid. Three layers of personal security. Married, two children. No obvious vulnerabilities. The file noted: *Extremely security-conscious. Trusts no one. Previous seduction attempts (by Chronos's own security as loyalty tests) all failed. Probability of successful operation: 15%.*

Elena closed the file. Too difficult. Too risky.

She opened the second dossier.

**Minister Petra Sokolov, 52, Chronos Historical Defense**

Highest-level access. Public figure. Constantly surrounded by staff and security. Married to her work. The file noted: *Too high-profile. Any relationship would be scrutinized. Compromise would trigger immediate investigation. Probability of successful operation: 8%.*

Elena closed that file too. Impossible.

She opened the third dossier, and her breath caught.

**Julian Kovač, 39, Senior Historian**

The photo showed a man with kind eyes, slight smile, scholarly bearing. The file detailed his life: Born in Chronos. Brilliant historian. Published extensively on historical verification methodologies. Married at 28. Wife died in accident two years ago. No children. Devoted to his work. Recently became distributed truth advocate.

Elena read further. Six months ago, Julian had been the target of a seduction operation. Veridica intelligence had identified him as vulnerable, accessible, perfect for infiltration. The operation had been approved, planned, ready to execute.

And then Marcus Chen had refused. Chosen transparency over corruption. Saved Julian by refusing to weaponize trust.

Julian had been grateful. Had reached out through back-channels to thank Marcus. Had become even more committed to distributed truth advocacy, seeing Marcus as proof that good people could resist corruption.

The irony was devastating.

Elena studied Julian's psychological profile: *Lonely. Idealistic. Craves intellectual connection. Believes in the nobility of historical work. Vulnerable to someone who shares his passion. Recent doubts about Chronos's fact warfare tactics—questions whether it serves truth or power.*

The file concluded: *Perfect target. High-level access. Low security consciousness. Trusts reformers due to Marcus Chen's previous refusal to compromise him. Probability of successful operation: 87%.*

Elena closed the dossier, sat back in her chair. Julian Kovač was perfect. Vulnerable. Trusting. Exactly the kind of person who would fall for a carefully crafted seduction.

Exactly the kind of person who didn't deserve it.

The door opened. Marcus entered, looking tired. He'd been working around the clock, coordinating the operation, managing the team, carrying the weight of the decision.

"Have you chosen?" he asked.

Elena pushed Julian's dossier across the table. Marcus picked it up, looked at the photo, and flinched.

"I saved him," Marcus said quietly. "Six months ago, I chose not to do this to him. I thought I was being principled. I thought I was proving that we could be better than our enemies. Now I'm asking you to finish what I refused to start."

"You want to back out?" Elena asked. "We can find another target. Chen Wei is difficult but not impossible. Or we could wait, find someone else."

"No." Marcus set down the dossier. "He's perfect. He has the access, the vulnerability, the trust. Because of me, he trusts reformers. He'll trust you."

"That makes it worse, doesn't it? That he'll trust me because of you."

"Yes. It makes it much worse."

Elena studied Marcus. Saw the guilt in his eyes. The self-loathing. The terrible awareness of what he was doing. Good. She didn't want to work with someone who could do this casually.

"He's a good man, Marcus," Elena said, tapping the dossier. "From everything I'm reading, he's genuinely principled. He's questioning the fact war because it harms people. He's exactly the kind of person we should be allying with, not destroying."

"I know."

"And we're going to destroy him anyway."

"Yes."

Elena stood, walked to the wall screen, pulled up Julian's published research. She skimmed the titles: "Ethical Constraints in Historical Verification." "The Historian's Duty to Truth Over Nation." "Distributed Truth as Democratic Innovation."

"He believes in what we're fighting for," she said. "He's advocating for the same principles we claim to defend. And we're going to use those principles against him."

"Yes."

"Then let's be clear about what we're doing." Elena turned to face Marcus. "We're not saving Veridica. We're not defending truth. We're sacrificing a good man to win a war. Let's not dress it up as anything noble."

Marcus nodded. "Agreed. No noble lies. We're doing something terrible for practical reasons. That's all."

"Good." Elena pulled up a blank document on the screen. "Then let's plan how to destroy him."

---

Elena spent the next hour creating her cover identity.

**Dr. Elena Sokolov** (the name a deliberate echo of Petra Sokolov, adding authenticity). Independent historian from Synthesis, the neutral Histologic nation. Researching cross-national historical methodologies. Published several papers (real papers, written under pseudonym, now attributed to the cover identity). Attending the upcoming International Conference on Historical Verification in Memoria.

Julian would be there. He was presenting a paper on ethical constraints. Elena would "accidentally" attend his presentation, ask an insightful question, strike up a conversation afterward.

Intellectual connection first. Shared passion for history. Gradual personal intimacy. Eventually, romance.

Timeline: six to eight weeks from first contact to obtaining access credentials.

"It's a honey trap," Elena said, using the old-world term. "Cold War era tactic. Seduction as espionage. Nothing new. Just mechanized for the Histologic age."

Marcus was reviewing the timeline. "Eight weeks. That's a long time to maintain a false identity. A long time to pretend."

"I've done longer. Three months once, during the resistance years. You get used to it."

"Do you? Get used to it?"

Elena was quiet for a moment. "No. You don't get used to it. You just get better at pretending you have."

She pulled up video footage of Julian—conference presentations, public lectures, casual conversations. Studied his mannerisms. The way he gestured when excited about an idea. The way his face lit up when discussing historical methodology. The way he smiled, rare but genuine.

She memorized his published papers. Learned his research interests. Identified the intellectual hooks she could use—the questions that would intrigue him, the ideas that would engage him, the debates that would draw him in.

She was good at this. Too good, maybe. She could become whoever someone needed her to be. Could mirror their interests, match their energy, provide exactly the connection they craved.

It was a skill. A weapon. Nothing personal.

Except this time, it felt personal. Because Julian Kovač wasn't a corrupt official or a system enforcer. He was a good man who believed in truth and questioned power and advocated for the same principles Elena had once believed in.

Before she'd learned that principles were luxuries you abandoned when survival required it.

"He's recently widowed," Marcus said, reading from the psychological profile. "Still grieving. Vulnerable to emotional connection."

"I know."

"You'll use that. His grief. His loneliness. His need for human connection."

"Yes."

"That's..." Marcus trailed off.

"Cruel? Yes. Effective? Also yes." Elena closed the video footage. "You want me to be honest about what we're doing? Fine. I'm going to exploit a grieving man's loneliness. I'm going to make him fall in love with me. I'm going to use his vulnerability against him. And then I'm going to betray him in the most devastating way possible."

"Elena—"

"No. You asked me to do this. You recruited me because I'm good at it. Because I can do it without falling apart. So don't flinch now. Don't pretend this is anything other than what it is."

Marcus was quiet for a long moment. Then: "You're right. I'm sorry."

"Don't apologize. Just remember what we're doing. Remember what it costs. And don't ever convince yourself this was justified."

"I won't."

"Good." Elena saved her cover identity files, encrypted them, backed them up. "The conference is in two weeks. I'll need that time to establish my cover, create a digital footprint, make Dr. Elena Sokolov real enough to pass scrutiny."

"What do you need from us?"

"Background support. If Julian checks my credentials, he needs to find a real person. Published papers, conference attendance records, professional connections. Kira can handle the digital infrastructure. I'll handle the human element."

Marcus nodded. "Anything else?"

Elena looked at Julian's photo again. Kind eyes. Slight smile. A good man who believed in truth.

"Yes," she said. "One thing. When this is over, when we've won, when Julian's life is destroyed and Chronos's factorepo is corrupted and the fact war is ended... I want you to remember his face. I want you to remember that we did this to a good person. Not because he deserved it, but because it was convenient."

"I will."

"I hope so. Because if we forget, if we start thinking this was justified, if we convince ourselves we were heroes... then we really will have become what we fought against."

---

That night, Elena sat alone in her apartment, reviewing Julian's research. She needed to know him. Understand him. Become the person he'd fall in love with.

She read his paper on ethical constraints. It was brilliant. Thoughtful. Arguing that historians had a duty to truth that transcended national loyalty. That verification systems should serve accuracy, not power. That the fact war was a betrayal of the historian's fundamental purpose.

She read his paper on distributed truth. He argued it was a democratic innovation, a way to prevent centralized control over history, a safeguard against authoritarian manipulation.

He believed in everything Elena had once believed in. Before the resistance years had taught her that survival required compromise. Before she'd learned that principles were luxuries and pragmatism was survival.

She wondered what he'd think of her. The real her, not the cover identity. Would he understand? Would he see her as a tragic figure, forced by circumstances to betray her principles? Or would he see her as she saw herself—someone who'd made choices, one compromise at a time, until she'd become someone she didn't recognize?

Elena closed the research files, looked at her reflection in the darkened window. She was forty-four years old. She'd spent twenty years fighting, compromising, surviving. She'd done terrible things for good reasons. She'd betrayed people who trusted her. She'd weaponized intimacy and love and human connection.

And she was about to do it again.

To a good man. Who didn't deserve it. Who'd done nothing wrong except work for the wrong nation and have the wrong access credentials.

She wondered if that mattered. Probably not. But she wondered anyway.

In two weeks, she'd meet Julian Kovač at a conference. She'd ask an insightful question. She'd strike up a conversation. She'd become Dr. Elena Sokolov, independent historian, intellectual equal, potential friend.

And eventually, potential lover.

And then she'd destroy him.

Elena turned away from the window, back to her preparation. She had work to do. A cover identity to perfect. A seduction to plan. A good man to betray.

Someone had to do it.

Might as well be her.

She'd stopped feeling guilty years ago.
