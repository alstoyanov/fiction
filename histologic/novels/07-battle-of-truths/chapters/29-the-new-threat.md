# Chapter 29: The New Threat

**Date**: May 2110  
**Location**: Veridica, Military Intelligence headquarters

---

General Yevgenia Sokolov stood before the defense council, presenting intelligence that terrified her. She'd been monitoring SFW military activity for months. What she saw wasn't posturing. It was preparation.

"SFW is mobilizing for war," she said, pulling up satellite imagery. "Not preparing—mobilizing. They're moving troops to the border, stockpiling supplies, running invasion simulations. Timeline: six to twelve months until they're ready to attack."

Chancellor Petrov leaned forward. "Are you certain? SFW has always been hostile. This might be posturing."

"No, Chancellor. This is different." Sokolov pulled up more data. "Look at the troop movements. Look at the supply chains. Look at the training exercises. They're not posturing—they're preparing for invasion."

Defense Minister Volkov asked: "Why now? What's changed?"

"Us. We changed. The fact war. Isaiah Okonkwo's article. We proved that Histologic systems can be corrupted, that we're divided, that we fight each other instead of external threats. We look weak."

"We won the fact war."

"Yes. And in doing so, we made ourselves look like the perfect target."

---

Sokolov presented her strategic assessment:

**SFW's Perspective:**
- Histologic nations are distracted by fact wars
- Their systems are vulnerable to infiltration
- They're divided (Veridica vs. Chronos)
- They've proven they'll corrupt their own principles
- They look weak, not strong

**SFW's Advantages:**
- Larger military (250 million population)
- Religious unity (strong morale)
- No dependence on corruptible systems
- International sympathy (after Isaiah's article)
- Strategic momentum

**Veridica's Vulnerabilities:**
- Just fought a fact war (resources depleted)
- Relationship with Chronos damaged
- Internal resistance divided
- International reputation as corruptible
- No allies prepared to help

"The worst part," Sokolov said, "is that we did this to ourselves. We won the fact war. But in doing so, we made ourselves look vulnerable. SFW sees us as technologically advanced but systemically weak. They think they can win."

Chancellor Petrov asked the critical question: "Can we win a conventional war with SFW?"

Sokolov took a breath. "Alone? No. With Chronos as ally? Maybe. With all Histologic nations united? Yes."

"Will Chronos ally with us after what we did to them?"

"I don't know. But we need to try."

Defense Minister Volkov pressed: "What if we're wrong? What if SFW isn't planning invasion?"

"Then we've wasted resources on preparation. But if we're right and we don't prepare, we lose everything. Our nation. Our people. Our way of life."

The council voted. Unanimous. Begin military preparation. Seek alliance with Chronos. Mobilize defenses.

The fact war was over.

The blood war was coming.

After the briefing, Sokolov met privately with Marcus Chen. They'd worked together since "The Divided Truth"—she respected him, even if she didn't always agree with him.

"Marcus, I need you to understand something. The operation you ran against Chronos? It worked. You ended the fact war. You saved civilian lives. You protected Veridica."

"But?"

"But you also invited this invasion. You proved we're vulnerable. You showed SFW that Histologic systems can be corrupted. You gave them the strategic opening they needed."

Marcus sat down heavily. "So we won the fact war and started a blood war."

"Yes. That's exactly what happened."

"And now?"

"Now we fight. We defend. We try to survive what we caused."

Marcus looked at her. "Are you asking me to help?"

"Chancellor Petrov will ask you formally. But yes. We need strategists who understand both Histologic and non-Histologic thinking. We need people who can think unconventionally. We need you."

"I'm done with covert operations. I'm done with deception."

"This won't be covert. This will be open war. Defense of our nation, our people, our way of life."

"Our way of life that I just proved is corruptible?"

"Yes. That one. Flawed, vulnerable, imperfect. But ours. And worth defending."

Marcus was quiet for a long time. "I need to think about it."

"Think fast. SFW won't wait for you to resolve your guilt."

---

Sokolov returned to her office, reviewed the intelligence again. The numbers were grim. SFW had advantages in almost every category. Veridica's only hope was alliance with other Histologic nations.

She pulled up a secure channel, contacted Chronos Military Command. The response was cold but professional.

"General Sokolov. What do you want?"

"To discuss mutual defense. SFW is preparing to invade Veridica. If they succeed, Chronos will be next."

"Why should we help you? After what you did to us?"

"Because the alternative is watching us fall and then facing SFW alone. Because Histologic nations need to stand together. Because pragmatism matters more than grudges."

Silence. Then: "Send your proposal. We'll review it."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank us. We're not doing this for you. We're doing it for ourselves."

The channel closed. Sokolov sat back, exhausted. She'd secured a potential alliance. But it was fragile, built on necessity rather than trust.

She thought: *We destroyed their history. They know it. We know they know it. And now we're asking them to die defending us.*

*This is what corruption costs. This is what winning through deception means. We got our victory. Now we have to defend it.*

That evening, Sokolov visited Mikhail "Old Songs" Petrov. The old man was in his apartment, listening to music. "Fortunate Son" by Creedence Clearwater Revival.

"General," Mikhail said. "Come to ask an old man for wisdom?"

"Come to ask a friend for perspective."

Mikhail turned down the music. "What's troubling you?"

"SFW is preparing to invade. We won the fact war and invited a blood war. And I'm asking people to die defending what we corrupted."

"And you feel guilty about that."

"Yes."

"Good. You should. Guilt means you still have a conscience." Mikhail poured tea. "But guilt doesn't change what's coming. SFW is mobilizing. Veridica needs defending. And you're the one who has to organize that defense."

"How do I ask people to die for a system we just proved is corruptible?"

"You don't. You ask them to die for each other. For their families. For their homes. For the people they love. Systems are abstract. People are real."

"That's not enough."

"No. It's not. But it's all we have." Mikhail sipped his tea. "General, I've lived through three wars. I've seen good people die for bad reasons. I've seen bad people survive for no reason. I've learned that war doesn't care about justice or righteousness or who deserves to win."

"Then what does it care about?"

"Preparation. Strategy. Will. And luck. You can't control luck. But you can control the rest."

"Is that enough to win?"

"I don't know. But it's enough to fight. And sometimes fighting is all we can do."

Sokolov returned to Military Intelligence headquarters. Her staff was working through the night, analyzing SFW movements, planning defensive positions, coordinating with Chronos.

She pulled up the strategic map. Veridica's border with SFW. Two hundred kilometers of potential invasion routes. Not enough troops to defend it all. Not enough time to prepare properly.

But they'd try anyway.

Because the alternative was surrender.

She thought about Marcus Chen, carrying guilt for ending the fact war. About Elena Volkov, carrying guilt for destroying Julian Kovač. About everyone who'd participated in the Chronos operation, living with what they'd done.

She thought: *They won the fact war by becoming what they fought against. Now they have to defend what they became. The irony isn't lost on me.*

*But irony doesn't stop invasions. Strategy does. Preparation does. Will does.*

*So we prepare. We strategize. We find the will to fight.*

*And we hope it's enough.*

Sokolov pulled up a communication to all Veridica military units:

**STRATEGIC ALERT: ELEVATED THREAT LEVEL**

*Intelligence indicates SFW military mobilization for potential invasion. Timeline: 6-12 months. All units begin defensive preparation. Coordinate with Chronos alliance. Mobilize reserves. This is not a drill.*

*We face an existential threat. We will defend our nation, our people, our way of life.*

*Prepare for war.*

She sent the message, knowing it would change everything. Knowing that Veridica's peace was ending. Knowing that the fact war's conclusion had been just a pause before something worse.

She thought about the old saying: "Out of the frying pan, into the fire."

They'd escaped the fact war. Now they faced invasion.

They'd won through corruption. Now they'd defend through blood.

They'd proven their system was vulnerable. Now they'd prove they could still fight.

---

Late that night, Sokolov stood at her office window, looking out at Veridica. The city was peaceful. Quiet. Unaware that war was coming. Unaware that their military was mobilizing. Unaware that the fact war's end had been just the beginning.

She thought about her journey. Captain in "The Divided Truth," fighting against corruption. Now General, preparing to defend a nation that had won through corruption.

She thought about the Volkov triplets—her distant relatives, her comrades in the resistance. Alexei, Dmitri, Elena. All of them carrying guilt. All of them fractured by the Chronos operation.

She thought about Marcus Chen, who'd saved her nation and invited its destruction.

She thought about Julian Kovač, destroyed by the very principles he'd believed in.

She thought about all of them, trapped in the consequences of their choices.

And she thought: *We're all paying the price now. For the fact war. For the corruption. For winning through deception.*

*SFW sees us as weak. They're not wrong. We are weak. Divided. Guilty. Fractured.*

*But we're also desperate. And desperate people fight harder than confident ones.*

*So maybe we have a chance.*

*Maybe.*

Sokolov turned away from the window, back to her work. Tomorrow, she'd brief the Chancellor. Tomorrow, she'd coordinate with Chronos. Tomorrow, she'd begin the long process of preparing for war.

But tonight, she just stood in her office, carrying the weight of what was coming, and hoping they'd be ready.

Hoping it would be enough.

Hoping they could survive what they'd caused.

The fact war was over.

The blood war was coming.

And Veridica had six months to prepare.

*End of Chapter 29*
