## The Professional

Elena Volkov—not Sokolov, never Sokolov, that was just the mask—sat in her hotel room at 0200 hours, encrypted comm unit open, typing her daily report to Marcus.

*Day 18. Target fully engaged. Trust level: 95%. Emotional attachment: confirmed. Access protocols: observed but not yet obtained. Facility layout: 60% mapped. Security vulnerabilities: three identified. Timeline: on schedule.*

She paused, fingers hovering over the keyboard. Added: *Personal status: operational.*

It was a lie. Her personal status was compromised. But Marcus didn't need to know that yet.

She sent the report, waited for confirmation. It came thirty seconds later: *Received. Good work. Maintain current approach. Technical team ready when you are.*

Elena closed the comm unit, looked around her hotel room. It was sterile, anonymous, the kind of place that left no impression. Like her. Like Dr. Elena Sokolov, the fabricated identity that was becoming more real than the woman underneath.

She pulled up her surveillance photos from the day. Julian at his desk in the Archives. Julian walking to lunch. Julian smiling at something on his comm unit—probably a message from her.

She studied his face. Kind eyes. Genuine smile. The face of a good man who believed in truth and questioned power and trusted people who didn't deserve it.

The face of a man she was going to destroy.

Elena closed the photos, poured herself a drink from the minibar. Vodka. Straight. She toasted the empty room: "To necessary evils. And to the people who do them so others don't have to."

The drink burned going down. Good. She deserved the burn.

## The Complication

The next day, Elena met with Alexei Volkov at a café in the neutral zone between districts. To anyone watching, they were strangers having coffee. In reality, they were siblings coordinating an operation.

Alexei was undercover in Chronos, posing as a trade liaison from Synthesis. He provided logistical support, secure communications, extraction routes. He was also the only person who knew the real Elena—not the operative, not the mask, but the woman underneath.

"How's it going?" he asked, stirring his coffee.

"According to plan. He's falling exactly as predicted."

"And you?"

"I'm doing my job."

Alexei studied her with eyes that had known her for forty-four years. "Elena, be careful. You're spending a lot of time with him. Don't let it become real."

"It won't."

"You're lying."

Elena felt something twist in her chest. "I'm not—"

"You are. I can tell. You're developing feelings for him."

"It's just... professional empathy. Understanding the target. It makes the operation more effective."

"Bullshit." Alexei leaned forward. "I've seen you do this before. You seduce targets, extract information, disappear. You're good at it because you don't feel anything. But this time is different. You're feeling something."

Elena was quiet for a long moment. Then: "He's genuinely good, Alexei. Not naively good—he understands the world's complexity. But principled good. He questions the fact war because it harms people. He respects Marcus Chen because Marcus chose principles over expediency. He treats me—or who he thinks I am—with respect, kindness, intellectual equality."

"So?"

"So I'm destroying a good man who doesn't deserve it. And I'm starting to care that I'm doing it."

"Then abort. Find another target."

"There is no other target. He's perfect. High-level access, low security consciousness, complete trust. Anyone else would be harder, riskier, more likely to fail."

"Then what are you going to do?"

Elena drank her coffee, looked out at the street. "I'm going to complete the mission. Because someone has to. And if I don't, someone else will. Someone who won't feel guilty about it. At least I know what I'm doing is terrible. At least I'm not pretending it's noble."

Alexei was quiet for a moment. "You're becoming what we fought against."

"I know. But what's the alternative? Let the fact war continue? Let more civilians suffer? Let Veridica fall?"

"There's always an alternative."

"No. There isn't. Not anymore. We're past the point of good choices. Now we just have bad choices and worse choices. And I'm choosing the bad one so we don't have to make the worse one."

Alexei reached across the table, squeezed her hand. "I'm sorry, Elena. I'm sorry you have to do this."

"Don't be sorry. Just be ready. When this goes down, I'll need extraction. Fast."

"I'll be ready."

They finished their coffee in silence, two siblings who'd spent their lives fighting for principles they were now betraying. Then they left separately, strangers again, returning to their covers.

## The Calculation

That evening, Elena had dinner with Julian at his apartment. He cooked—surprisingly well—and they talked about history, philosophy, the nature of truth. It was easy. Natural. The kind of conversation she'd have with a friend, not a target.

Except he was a target. And she was an operative. And none of this was real.

Except it was starting to feel real.

After dinner, they sat on his couch, and Julian told her about his doubts regarding the fact war. "I don't know if I can keep doing this," he said. "Working for Chronos while they wage psychological warfare. Being complicit in harming people."

Elena listened, asked questions, provided the responses he needed. She was good at this. Too good. She could read people, understand what they needed to hear, provide exactly the right support.

It was a skill. A weapon. Nothing personal.

Except this time, she meant what she said. She genuinely thought he should resign, speak out, join the distributed truth movement. She genuinely respected his principles, his courage, his willingness to question power.

She was falling for him.

Not completely—she knew this was a mission, knew it had to end, knew she'd betray him. But enough. Enough to make it hurt. Enough to make her hate herself.

Later, after they'd made love, Julian fell asleep beside her. Elena lay awake, watching him breathe, thinking about what was coming.

She could stop this. She could warn him, abort the mission, find another way. But that would mean the fact war continues. More civilians suffer. Veridica falls. And eventually, someone else would target Julian—someone who wouldn't feel guilty, someone who wouldn't hesitate, someone who'd destroy him without a second thought.

At least Elena knew what she was doing was terrible. At least she wasn't pretending this was justified.

At least she'd carry the guilt.

She got up quietly, went to the bathroom, looked at herself in the mirror. The woman looking back was a stranger. Hard eyes. Professional mask. The face of someone who'd made too many compromises, crossed too many lines, become something she didn't recognize.

She thought of the old-world spies—the "swallows," they'd called them. Female operatives who used seduction as weapon. She'd always despised them. Thought they were traitors to themselves, selling their intimacy for strategic advantage.

Now she was one of them.

Elena returned to the bedroom, slipped back into bed beside Julian. He stirred, reached for her in his sleep, pulled her close. She let him hold her, feeling the warmth of his body, the trust in his touch.

She thought: *I'm becoming what I fought against. But at least I know it. At least I'm not pretending this is noble.*

It wasn't much comfort.

But it was all she had.

## The Access

The next week, Elena began positioning for the critical phase. She mentioned her research required accessing certain classified archives—records of the Border Wars, verification protocols, backup system documentation.

"I've hit a wall," she told Julian over dinner. "The public records don't have the detail I need. But I understand if you can't help. I don't want you to break protocol for me."

Julian hesitated. She could see the conflict on his face. Protocol said no. But trust said yes.

"I shouldn't," he said. "It's against regulations to share credentials."

"I know. Forget I asked."

But he didn't forget. Over the next few days, she could see him thinking about it, wrestling with the decision. She didn't push. Didn't manipulate. Just let him work through it on his own.

Because she knew what he'd decide. She knew him. Knew his principles. Knew that Marcus Chen had taught him that sometimes doing the right thing means trusting good people, even when protocols say otherwise.

She knew he'd say yes.

And she hated that she knew.

Finally, one evening at his apartment, Julian said: "I'll give you access. To the archives you need. But you have to promise me—only for research. Only what you need. And you protect my credentials."

Elena looked moved—it wasn't hard to fake, because she was genuinely moved. Moved by his trust. Moved by his willingness to break rules for someone he cared about. Moved by the terrible awareness that she was about to weaponize that trust.

"Julian, I can't ask you to break protocol for me."

"You're not asking. I'm offering. Because I trust you. Because Marcus Chen taught me that sometimes trust matters more than protocol. He trusted me six months ago, refused to compromise me. That trust changed my life. Now I want to pay it forward."

Elena felt something break inside her. He was trusting her because of Marcus. Because Marcus had shown him that good people could resist corruption. And now Marcus was using that lesson to destroy him.

The irony was devastating.

"Thank you," she said quietly. "I won't betray your trust."

It was the most honest lie she'd ever told.

## The Guilt

That night, lying beside Julian after they'd made love, Elena stared at the ceiling and thought about what she'd become.

She had his credentials. She had the facility layout. She had everything she needed to complete the mission. In a few days, the team would infiltrate Chronos's factorepo, replace the backup with Veridica's version, and end the fact war.

And Julian would be destroyed. His career ruined. His trust shattered. His belief that good people could resist corruption proven false.

All because he'd trusted her. All because Marcus had taught him to trust. All because he'd been good and principled and willing to believe in people.

Elena turned to look at him. He was sleeping peacefully, one arm draped across her waist, his face relaxed and happy. He looked younger in sleep. Vulnerable. Innocent.

She thought about warning him. About telling him the truth. About giving him a chance to protect himself.

But that would mean the mission fails. The fact war continues. More civilians suffer. And eventually, someone else would come for him—someone who wouldn't hesitate, someone who wouldn't feel guilty, someone who'd destroy him without a second thought.

At least Elena cared. At least she knew this was terrible. At least she'd carry the weight of what she'd done.

It wasn't much. But it was something.

She carefully extracted herself from his embrace, went to the bathroom, and sent an encrypted message to Marcus: *Access obtained. Credentials confirmed. Ready for infiltration phase. Timeline: 72 hours.*

Marcus's response came quickly: *Confirmed. Team mobilizing. Good work, Elena.*

Good work. She'd seduced a good man, made him fall in love with her, extracted his trust, and set him up for destruction.

Good work.

Elena closed the comm unit, looked at herself in the mirror. The woman looking back was a stranger. Someone who weaponized intimacy. Someone who corrupted trust. Someone who'd become exactly what she'd once fought against.

She thought of an old phrase from the 20th century: "Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster."

Too late for that.

She was the monster now.

And in seventy-two hours, she'd prove it.
