# Chapter 5: The Desperate Plan

**Date**: Late October 2109  
**Location**: Veridica, Government Complex

---

The Government Complex loomed against the gray October sky, all steel and glass and certainty. Marcus Chen passed through three security checkpoints, each one scanning his credentials, verifying his identity, confirming his clearance. The weight of what he was about to propose sat in his chest like a stone.

He'd spent the last forty-eight hours thinking. Calculating. Trying to find a third option, some way to end the fact war without compromising everything he believed in. He'd found nothing. Only two paths: maintain principles and lose, or abandon principles and win.

He'd made his choice.

Now he just had to live with it.

Chancellor Viktor Petrov's office was on the top floor, overlooking the capital. Marcus had been here before—six months ago, when he'd refused to approve the seduction operation. When he'd chosen transparency over corruption. When he'd saved Julian Kovač by refusing to compromise.

That choice had seemed so clear then. So obvious. The right thing to do.

Now it seemed naive. Privileged. The luxury of someone who didn't have to watch civilians suffer the consequences of his principles.

"Director Chen," Petrov's assistant said. "The Chancellor will see you now."

Marcus entered the office. Petrov stood by the window, hands clasped behind his back, looking out over the city. He was fifty-eight, silver-haired, wearing the weight of leadership like a familiar coat. He'd been Chancellor for twelve years, had navigated the transition to distributed truth without losing power. A survivor. A pragmatist.

"Marcus," Petrov said without turning. "You requested this meeting. I assume it's important."

"It is, Chancellor."

"Then please. Tell me why you're here."

Marcus set his tablet on Petrov's desk, pulled up the analysis he'd prepared. "We're losing the fact war. Not slowly—quickly. Within three months, Veridica's historical integrity will be compromised beyond repair. Our defensive measures aren't working. The civilian cost is mounting daily."

"I'm aware of the situation."

"Then you know we need to change strategy."

Petrov turned from the window, studied Marcus with sharp eyes. "What are you proposing?"

Marcus took a breath. This was the moment. The line he was about to cross. Once he spoke the words, there would be no going back.

"We end it," he said. "Not by defending better, but by making it impossible for Chronos to continue. We infiltrate their factorepo system. We replace their backup with our version of history. We force a system failure. They restore from backup, and suddenly they're operating on our historical framework."

Silence. Petrov stared at him. The office was so quiet Marcus could hear his own heartbeat.

"That's..." Petrov said slowly, "audacious. And completely illegal under international Histologic protocols."

"So is what they're doing to us, Chancellor. So is what they're doing to civilians in the border zones."

"Two wrongs don't make a right."

"No. But one right and one wrong makes a loss. And I'm not willing to accept that."

Petrov walked to his desk, sat down, gestured for Marcus to sit across from him. "Explain the technical feasibility."

Marcus pulled up the operational plan. "It's the same operation I was ordered to approve six months ago. The one targeting Julian Kovač. The one I refused."

"I remember. You chose principles over pragmatism. I respected that choice."

"I was wrong."

"Were you?"

Marcus met the Chancellor's eyes. "Six months ago, I thought maintaining our principles was worth the cost. Now I've seen the cost. Families torn apart. Children traumatized. People questioning their own sanity. Reality itself fracturing. And I realize: principles are luxuries. We can afford them when we're winning. When we're losing, we need pragmatism."

Petrov was quiet for a moment. Then: "You're quoting me. From our conversation six months ago."

"Yes."

"I didn't expect you to agree with me."

"Neither did I."

Petrov pulled up the operational plan, studied it. "Walk me through it."

Marcus explained. The seduction operation. Elena Volkov, resistance commander, would target a Chronos historian with high-level access. Build a relationship. Gain trust. Extract credentials. The Volkov brothers—Nikolai, Alexei, Dmitri—would provide technical support, infiltration expertise, security. Kira would build the replacement backup. Marcus would coordinate.

"The target," Petrov said. "Who did you have in mind?"

Marcus hesitated. Then: "Julian Kovač."

"The man you saved six months ago."

"Yes."

"The man who became a distributed truth advocate because you taught him that principles matter."

"Yes."

"And now you're proposing to destroy him."

"I'm proposing to use him. To weaponize the trust I taught him to have. To prove that his idealism was naive and my cynicism was correct." Marcus felt bile rising in his throat. "Yes, Chancellor. That's exactly what I'm proposing."

Petrov set down the tablet. "What would this cost us? Morally, I mean."

Marcus had been expecting this question. Had been asking it himself for forty-eight hours. "Everything we fought for. We'd become what we opposed. We'd prove that distributed truth advocates are willing to use centralized control when it suits us. We'd corrupt the system we're trying to protect. We'd weaponize trust, betray an ally, and demonstrate that our principles were just conveniences we abandoned when they became inconvenient."

"And if we don't?"

"Chronos wins. Distributed truth fails. The fact war continues, probably escalates. More civilians suffer. More families break apart. More people lose faith in reality itself. And the next fact war—because there will be a next one—will be even worse."

Petrov stood, walked to the window again. Marcus watched him, saw the calculation happening behind those sharp eyes. The Chancellor was weighing options, calculating costs, making the kind of decision that leaders had to make when all the choices were bad.

From somewhere outside, music drifted up. A café, maybe. Someone had put on old-world music. Marcus recognized the song: "Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones. *Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, but what's puzzling you is the nature of my game.*

Appropriate, Marcus thought bitterly. He was becoming the devil. Meeting people with a smile while planning their destruction.

"I can't officially authorize this," Petrov said finally. "The Council would never approve. International observers would condemn us. The other Histologic nations would see it as an act of war. We'd be pariahs."

"I understand."

"But." Petrov turned to face him. "I also can't let Veridica fall. I can't watch our citizens suffer while we maintain ideological purity. I can't be the Chancellor who chose principles over people and lost everything."

"So what are you saying?"

"I'm saying I know nothing about this. If you proceed, you do so without official sanction. If you succeed, I'll claim it was a diplomatic breakthrough—Chronos saw reason, agreed to cease hostilities, accepted a compromise historical framework. If you fail, I'll claim it was a rogue operation—unauthorized, condemned, prosecuted to the full extent of the law."

Marcus understood perfectly. Plausible deniability. The Chancellor was giving tacit approval while maintaining official distance. If the operation succeeded, Petrov would take credit. If it failed, Marcus would take the blame.

"Understood," Marcus said.

"You'll need a team. People you trust absolutely. People who understand what this will cost. People who are willing to pay that cost."

"I know who to recruit."

"Keep it small. The fewer people who know, the better. And Marcus?" Petrov's voice softened slightly. "Choose people who can live with this. Because you'll all have to live with it for the rest of your lives."

Marcus nodded. He'd already made his list. Elena Volkov—hardened, pragmatic, capable of the seduction operation. Nikolai Volkov—brilliant systems architect, technical genius. Alexei Volkov—ground support, logistics expert. Dmitri Volkov—security, muscle. Kira Osman—his partner, the only person he trusted completely.

People who'd fought beside him. People who'd understand the stakes. People who'd be willing to become what they'd fought against.

"There's one more thing," Marcus said. "If we do this, if we succeed, I want your commitment to real reforms. Transparency measures. Accountability protocols. Safeguards to make sure this never happens again."

Petrov smiled slightly. "You're negotiating the terms of your own corruption. I respect that."

"Do we have a deal?"

"You have my word. If you end the fact war, I'll implement reforms. Make the system more transparent, more accountable, more resistant to this kind of warfare. It won't be perfect—nothing ever is—but it will be better."

"Good enough."

Marcus stood, prepared to leave. At the door, Petrov called after him.

"Marcus? For what it's worth... I'm sorry it came to this. You deserved better than to be forced into this choice."

Marcus paused, hand on the doorknob. "We all did, Chancellor. But this is the world we have, not the world we wanted."

"No. It's not."

Marcus left the office, passed through the security checkpoints in reverse, emerged into the gray October afternoon. The music from the café was still playing. *Sympathy for the Devil*. He stood on the steps of the Government Complex, looking out at Veridica's capital.

Ordinary people going about their lives. Shopping. Working. Talking. Laughing. Unaware that their defender was about to become their corruptor. Unaware that the man who'd fought for transparency was about to execute the most opaque operation in Veridica's history.

They trusted him. Trusted the system. Trusted that someone was protecting them, defending them, maintaining the integrity of their reality.

And he was about to betray that trust by doing exactly what was necessary to preserve it.

The irony wasn't lost on him.

Marcus walked through the city, not ready to return to the office yet. He needed time to think. To process. To accept what he'd just committed to.

He found himself at a small park near the border zone. Families here. Children playing. A couple sitting on a bench, holding hands. Normal life. The kind of life the fact war was destroying.

He sat on a bench, watched a little girl chase a ball. She couldn't have been more than six. Laughing. Innocent. Unaware that reality itself was fracturing around her.

What would she think, in twenty years, when she learned what he'd done? Would she understand? Would she thank him for ending the fact war, even if the method was corrupt? Or would she condemn him for betraying the principles he'd claimed to defend?

Marcus didn't know. Couldn't know. Could only make the choice and live with the consequences.

His comm unit chimed. A message from Kira: *Where are you? We need to talk.*

He typed a response: *Park near border zone. Come meet me.*

Twenty minutes later, Kira arrived. She sat beside him, didn't speak, just took his hand. They sat together, watching the little girl play, watching the couple on the bench, watching normal life continue in the shadow of the fact war.

"I met with Petrov," Marcus said finally.

"And?"

"And I proposed the operation. He gave tacit approval. Plausible deniability. If we succeed, he takes credit. If we fail, we take the blame."

Kira was quiet for a moment. "So we're doing this."

"Yes."

"We're becoming what we fought against."

"Yes."

"We're destroying Julian Kovač, the man you saved six months ago."

"Yes."

"And we're going to have to live with that for the rest of our lives."

"Yes."

Kira squeezed his hand. "Okay."

"Okay?"

"Okay. I'm with you. Whatever happens, whatever we become, I'm with you."

Marcus felt something break inside him. Relief. Gratitude. Love. Fear. All of it mixing together into a complicated emotion he couldn't name.

"I need to recruit the team," he said. "Elena and the Volkov brothers. People who can handle this. People who understand what it costs."

"When do we start?"

"Soon. Within the week. The longer we wait, the more people suffer."

They sat in silence, watching the little girl play. She'd caught her ball now, was running back to her parents, laughing. Innocent. Safe. For now.

"That's why we're doing this," Kira said quietly. "For her. For all the children who deserve to grow up in a world where reality is stable. Where families don't split apart over incompatible facts. Where truth is something you can trust."

"Even if we have to corrupt truth to stabilize it."

"Even then."

Marcus thought about that. The paradox. The impossible logic. They were going to corrupt the system to save it. Betray trust to preserve it. Become villains to remain heroes.

"Mikhail would say there's a third option," Marcus said. "That we just haven't found it yet."

"Mikhail is eighty-one years old and still doesn't have answers. Maybe there is no third option. Maybe there are just choices, and consequences, and living with what we decide."

"That's what he said too."

"Then maybe he's right. Maybe wisdom isn't having answers. Maybe it's accepting that there aren't any."

The little girl ran past them, chasing her ball again. Her laughter echoed in the park. Pure. Joyful. Untouched by the fact war.

For now.

Marcus stood, pulled Kira to her feet. "Let's go. We have a team to recruit and a war to end."

"And principles to betray."

"And principles to betray."

They walked out of the park together, leaving the little girl to her innocence, leaving the couple to their happiness, leaving normal life to continue for as long as it could.

Behind them, the music from the café drifted on the wind.

*Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, but what's puzzling you is the nature of my game.*

Marcus knew the nature of his game now.

He was the devil.

And he was going to save the world.
