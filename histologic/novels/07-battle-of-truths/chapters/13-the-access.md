# Chapter 13: The Access

**Date**: Mid-December 2109  
**Location**: Chronos, Julian's home and factorepo facility

---

Julian Kovač woke up happy.

It was a strange feeling after two years of waking up alone, two years of grief and loneliness and the slow erosion of hope. But this morning, with Elena sleeping beside him, sunlight streaming through the window, he felt something he'd thought he'd lost forever.

Joy.

He got up quietly, made coffee, stood at his window looking out at Chronos. The city looked different now. Brighter. More alive. As if Elena's presence had changed not just his life, but the world itself.

He knew it was irrational. Knew he was probably moving too fast, feeling too much, trusting too completely. But he didn't care. After two years of careful distance, of emotional protection, of refusing to feel anything...

He wanted to feel everything.

Elena emerged from the bedroom, wearing one of his shirts, her hair tousled. She looked beautiful. Real. Like someone who belonged in his life.

"Coffee?" he offered.

"Please."

They sat together on his couch, drinking coffee, watching the city wake up. Comfortable silence. The kind of silence that only exists between people who don't need to fill every moment with words.

"I told Minister Sokolov about you," Julian said.

Elena's expression flickered—surprise? concern?—but smoothed quickly. "You did?"

"Just that I'm seeing someone. She smiled and said 'It's about time, Julian.' Everyone's been worried about me. Apparently, I've been too serious lately."

"And now?"

"Now I'm happy. Because of you."

Elena set down her coffee, took his hand. "Julian, I need to ask you something. About my research."

"Of course. Anything."

"I've hit a wall. The public archives don't have the detail I need—records of the Border Wars, verification protocols, backup system documentation. I need access to the classified archives."

Julian felt his stomach tighten. "Those archives are restricted. I'd need to give you my credentials."

"I know. I shouldn't have asked. Forget it."

But Julian couldn't forget it. He spent the day thinking about it, wrestling with the decision. Protocol said no. Regulations were clear. Sharing credentials was a violation, potentially a security threat.

But Elena wasn't a threat. She was a serious scholar from a neutral nation. She wasn't involved in the fact war. She just needed access for legitimate research.

And more importantly: he trusted her.

He thought about Marcus Chen. Six months ago, Marcus had been ordered to approve a seduction operation against Julian. The operation had been planned, ready to execute. But Marcus had refused. Chosen transparency over corruption. Saved Julian by refusing to weaponize trust.

That choice had changed Julian's life. Had shown him that good people could resist corruption, that principles mattered more than expediency, that trust was more powerful than control.

Now Julian wanted to pay it forward. Elena was good people. She deserved trust.

Sometimes doing the right thing meant trusting good people, even when protocols said otherwise.

---

That evening, over dinner at his apartment, Julian made his decision.

"I'll give you access," he said. "To the archives you need. But you have to promise me—only for research. Only what you need. And you protect my credentials."

Elena looked genuinely moved. "Julian, I can't ask you to break protocol for me."

"You're not asking. I'm offering. Because I trust you." He reached across the table, took her hands. "Marcus Chen taught me something six months ago. He taught me that sometimes trust matters more than protocol. That good people should trust each other, even when it's risky. He trusted me when he didn't have to, and it changed my life. Now I want to pay that forward."

Elena's eyes were wet. "You're a good man, Julian."

"I'm just trying to be worthy of the trust people put in me. Like Marcus's trust. Like yours."

"Mine?"

"You trust me with your research, your ideas, your time. You trust me with... with your heart. That's not nothing. That's everything."

Elena pulled him into a kiss. It was desperate, almost frantic. Julian didn't understand why, but he kissed her back, feeling the intensity of her emotion.

When they pulled apart, Elena said quietly: "I promise I won't betray your trust."

"I know you won't."

The next day, Julian took Elena to the Chronos Historical Factorepo Facility. He'd arranged visitor access, filled out the proper forms, followed all protocols except the one about sharing credentials.

They passed through security checkpoints—biometric scans, credential verification, guard inspections. Elena was professional, polite, appropriately impressed by the facility's security.

Julian didn't notice how carefully she was observing everything. The guard rotations. The checkpoint procedures. The system access points. The backup server locations.

He thought she was just interested in the architecture. He had no idea she was mapping the target.

"This is impressive," Elena said as they entered the main verification chamber. "The integration between The Judge and the factorepo is seamless."

"It has to be. Any gap in the system could allow corruption. That's why security is so tight."

"And yet you're giving me access."

Julian smiled. "Because I trust you. And because sometimes security means trusting the right people, not just blocking everyone."

He showed her how to use his credentials, which systems she could access, where to find the archives she needed. He even gave her a brief tour of the backup systems—"Just so you understand the architecture."

Elena memorized everything. Every detail. Every vulnerability. Every access point.

And Julian, trusting and happy, had no idea he was handing her the keys to Chronos's destruction.

That evening, back at his apartment, they made love. It was intense, emotional, almost desperate on Elena's part. Julian held her afterward, feeling her trembling against him.

"Are you okay?" he asked.

"Yes. I just... I'm overwhelmed. By you. By this. By everything."

"Good overwhelmed or bad overwhelmed?"

"I don't know. Both, maybe."

They lay together in the darkness. Julian felt complete. Whole. Like he'd found something he didn't know he'd been missing.

"Thank you for being in my life," he said. "I didn't think I'd feel this way again after losing my wife. You've given me hope."

Elena held him tighter, hiding her face against his chest. "You've given me something too, Julian. Something I didn't expect."

He thought she meant love. She meant guilt.

Later, when Julian was in the shower, Elena sat on his bed and looked at the photo on his nightstand. His wife. Smiling. Beautiful. Dead two years.

Elena thought: *I'm using her death to manipulate him. I'm using his grief as a weapon. I'm exploiting the very vulnerability that makes him human.*

She heard the shower turn off. Composed herself. Put on the mask.

Julian emerged, toweling his hair, smiling. "Wine?"

"Please."

They sat together on his couch, drinking wine, talking about truth and trust. Julian was philosophical, passionate, genuine.

"The fact war is wrong because it treats truth as a weapon," he said. "But truth should be something we share, not something we fight over. That's what Marcus Chen taught me—that transparency and trust are more powerful than control and deception."

Elena asked carefully: "What if trust is betrayed? What if transparency is weaponized?"

"Then the person who betrayed trust has to live with that. But I'd rather be someone who trusted and was betrayed than someone who never trusted at all. Because trust is what makes us human. Without it, we're just... mechanisms. Systems. Not people."

Elena was quiet for a long time. Finally: "You're a better person than most, Julian."

"I'm just trying to be worthy of the trust people put in me."

He showed her more photos of his wife. Told stories about their life together. Shared his grief openly, honestly.

"She would have liked you," he said. "She always said I needed someone who challenged my thinking. Someone who made me question my assumptions. You do that."

Elena looked at the photo of the smiling woman, dead two years, her memory being weaponized by a spy who was sleeping with her widower.

"She was beautiful," Elena said. "You must have loved her very much."

"I did. I do. But I'm learning that loving someone who's gone doesn't mean I can't love someone who's here. I think she'd want me to be happy. And you make me happy, Elena. You make me feel alive again."

Elena excused herself, went to the bathroom, and stared at herself in the mirror.

*He trusts me because Marcus taught him to trust. We're destroying him with the very principle that makes him good. We're proving that his idealism was naive, that his trust was foolish, that doing the right thing leads to destruction.*

She composed herself, returned to the living room. Julian was looking at photos, smiling at memories. He looked up when she entered.

"Come here," he said, patting the couch beside him.

She sat. He put his arm around her. They looked at photos together—his past, her fabricated present, a future that would never exist.

"I love you," Julian said quietly. "I know it's fast. I know it's maybe crazy. But I do. I love you."

Elena felt something break inside her. "I love you too."

She meant it. And hated that she meant it.

They went to bed. Julian fell asleep quickly, peacefully, trusting. Elena lay awake beside him, his access credentials memorized, the facility layout mapped in her mind, the operation timeline counting down in her head.

Seventy-two hours until infiltration.

Seventy-two hours until she destroyed the man sleeping beside her.

Seventy-two hours until she proved that trust was weakness, that principles led to destruction, that doing the right thing was just another way to get hurt.

She thought: *I'm sorry, Julian. I'm so sorry. But I'm going to do it anyway.*

Because someone had to.

Because the fact war had to end.

Because more people would suffer if she didn't.

Because she was strong enough—or corrupted enough—to do terrible things for good reasons.

Elena got up quietly, went to the bathroom, sent an encrypted message to Marcus: *Access confirmed. Facility mapped. Timeline: 72 hours. He trusts me completely. He loves me. This is going to destroy him.*

Marcus's response came quickly: *I know. I'm sorry. But we proceed. Team mobilizing. Operation executes in 72 hours.*

Elena closed the comm unit, looked at herself in the mirror one last time.

The woman looking back was a monster.

But she was a monster with a mission.

And in seventy-two hours, she'd complete it.
