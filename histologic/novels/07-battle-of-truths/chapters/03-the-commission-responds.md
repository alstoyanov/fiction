# Chapter 3: The Commission Responds

**Date**: October 2109  
**Location**: Veridica, Historical Integrity Commission

---

The office was quiet at 2300 hours, just Kira Osman and the hum of servers processing verification requests. She'd sent her team home hours ago, but she couldn't leave. Not with the numbers she was seeing. Not with the flood of contradictory facts overwhelming their systems.

Her screens displayed a cascade of alerts. Red markers for suspicious entries. Yellow for pending verification. Green for confirmed authentic. The problem was the ratio: for every green marker, there were fifty red ones. And the yellow markers—the ones waiting for verification—numbered in the thousands.

They were drowning.

Kira pulled up the detection algorithm she'd been refining for the past month. It analyzed insertion patterns, cross-referenced authentication signatures, identified anomalies in temporal metadata. It was sophisticated. Elegant. State-of-the-art.

It wasn't enough.

She ran the diagnostic again, watched the numbers scroll past. In the last twenty-four hours, the system had flagged 3,847 suspicious fact insertions. The verification team had processed 312 of them. At this rate, they'd fall further behind every day.

Chronos was winning through sheer volume. Overwhelming the defenses. Flooding the zone.

Kira leaned back in her chair, rubbed her eyes. She'd been at this for sixteen hours straight. Her coffee had gone cold hours ago. Her back ached. Her head throbbed.

And somewhere in the border zones, people were suffering because she couldn't work fast enough.

Someone had left music playing in the break room. The melody drifted through the empty office—melancholy, haunting. She recognized it: "Mad World" by Tears for Fears. Pre-Histologic music. *All around me are familiar faces, worn out places, worn out faces.*

Appropriate, Kira thought. The world was going mad. Reality was fracturing. And she was supposed to hold it together with algorithms and verification protocols.

She pulled up the casualty reports.

---

The numbers were clinical. Sterile. But Kira knew what they represented.

**Border Zone Psychological Trauma Report - October 2109**

- Reality Fracture Syndrome diagnoses: 2,847 (up 340% from September)
- Cognitive Dissonance Disorder: 1,923 (up 280% from September)
- Family Dissolution due to incompatible facts: 412 cases (up 190% from September)
- Suicide attempts related to epistemological crisis: 23 (up from 3 in September)

Kira stared at that last number. Twenty-three people had tried to kill themselves because they couldn't handle the uncertainty. Because reality had become so unstable that death seemed preferable to confusion.

Three had succeeded.

She closed the report, opened another. This one contained individual case studies. Names. Stories. Real people.

*Elena Vasquez, 41, border resident. Hospitalized for severe cognitive dissonance after her personal history became incompatible with verified records. Unable to reconcile memories with facts. Currently sedated.*

*Mikhail Volkov, 45, Chronos citizen working in Veridica. Separated from wife due to incompatible historical memories. Reports feeling "unmoored from reality." Seeking psychological treatment.*

*Mira Vasquez, 12, student. Refusing to attend school after history lessons contradicted previous lessons. Experiencing anxiety attacks when asked to verify facts. Parents considering homeschooling.*

Kira closed the file, felt something twist in her chest. These weren't statistics. They were casualties. Real people whose lives were being destroyed by the fact war.

And she was supposed to protect them.

Her comm unit chimed. A message from Nikolai Volkov: *Still at the office? I'm coming up.*

Five minutes later, Nikolai appeared in her doorway with two cups of coffee. He was thirty-four, brilliant, one of the best systems architects in Veridica. Also one of the Volkov triplets—brothers who'd become central to the resistance movement.

"You look terrible," he said, handing her a cup.

"Thanks. You're a charmer."

"I'm serious, Kira. When did you last sleep?"

"I'll sleep when we're not losing the fact war."

Nikolai settled into the chair across from her, sipped his coffee. "So never, then."

Kira managed a tired smile. "Probably."

They sat in comfortable silence for a moment. She'd known Nikolai for years, had worked with him on countless projects. He was reliable. Thoughtful. The kind of person who saw problems from angles others missed.

"Show me the numbers," he said.

She pulled up the dashboard, let him review the data. Watched his face as he absorbed the scale of the problem. The flood of insertions. The overwhelmed verification systems. The growing backlog.

"We're losing," he said finally.

"I know."

"Not slowly. Quickly. Within two months, maybe three, Veridica's historical integrity will be compromised beyond repair."

"I know."

Nikolai set down his coffee, leaned forward. "So what do we do?"

"We keep fighting. Keep verifying. Keep protecting what we can."

"That's not a strategy, Kira. That's just... persistence in the face of inevitable defeat."

She felt a flash of anger. "What else do you want me to say? We're doing everything we can. We've implemented every defensive measure, every counter-protocol, every verification enhancement. We're working around the clock. And it's not enough. So yes, all we have left is persistence."

Nikolai held up his hands. "I'm not criticizing. I'm just... trying to understand our options."

"Our options are limited. We can't stop Chronos's insertions. We can only try to identify and quarantine them after the fact. But they're inserting faster than we can verify. The math doesn't work in our favor."

"What if we went on offense?"

Kira felt her stomach tighten. "You mean insert our own contradictory facts into Chronos's systems."

"Yes."

"That would make us exactly what we fought against."

Nikolai was quiet for a moment. Then: "Would it? Or would it just make us pragmatic?"

"There's a difference between pragmatism and corruption."

"Is there? Or is that just how we justify our choices?" He gestured at her screens. "We're defending truth by controlling information. We're protecting verification by deciding which facts to quarantine. We're maintaining historical integrity by determining what's authentic and what's false. Isn't that what we fought against? Centralized control over truth?"

Kira wanted to argue, but the words caught in her throat. Because he was right. They were controlling information. They were deciding what counted as truth. They were exercising the same kind of authority they'd once opposed.

"There's a difference," she said finally, "between protecting verification systems and dictating what's true. We're not inserting false facts. We're not rewriting history. We're defending the *process* of truth-finding."

"Are we? Or are we just defending our version of the process?"

"Nikolai—"

"I'm not saying you're wrong, Kira. I'm just saying... the line between defense and control is thinner than we'd like to admit. And if we cross that line, if we start inserting our own false facts into Chronos's systems, we'll have become exactly what we opposed. The only difference will be that we'll have better justifications."

Kira stared at her screens, at the cascade of red alerts, at the numbers that represented real suffering. "So what do you suggest?"

"I don't know. I'm a systems architect, not a philosopher. I just... I worry that we're going to compromise our principles and discover that the compromise didn't even work. That we'll become what we hate and still lose."

"And if we don't compromise? If we maintain ideological purity while people suffer?"

Nikolai didn't have an answer.

At midnight, Marcus arrived. He looked as exhausted as Kira felt. They'd been working parallel shifts—her on technical defenses, him on strategic planning. Trying to hold back the flood from two different angles.

"Show me the latest," he said.

Kira pulled up the reports. The insertion patterns. The casualty statistics. The verification backlog. Marcus absorbed it all in silence, his face growing darker with each screen.

"We're losing," he said finally.

"I know."

"Not slowly—"

"Quickly. Yes. Nikolai said the same thing. Two months, maybe three, before our historical integrity is compromised beyond repair."

Marcus walked to the window, looked out at the city. From here, they could see the lights of the border zone in the distance. Somewhere out there, Elena Vasquez was sedated in a hospital bed. Mikhail Volkov was separated from his wife. Mira Vasquez was too afraid to go to school.

"Petrov gave me forty-eight hours," Marcus said. "To decide whether to approve offensive operations."

"And?"

"And I don't know what to do." He turned to face her. "If we go on offense, we become what we fought against. We corrupt truth. We weaponize information. We betray everything we believed in."

"Yes."

"But if we don't, people keep suffering. Real people. Families torn apart. Children traumatized. Lives destroyed. And for what? So we can maintain our principles? So we can feel morally pure while the world burns?"

Kira heard the anguish in his voice. Recognized it because she felt the same thing.

"What if we went on offense?" Marcus asked quietly.

She'd been expecting this question. Had been asking it herself all evening. "That would make us like them."

"Or it would end the war before more people get hurt."

"Would it? Or would it just escalate the conflict? We attack them, they attack us harder, we respond, they respond, and suddenly we're in a spiral of mutual corruption that destroys both nations' historical integrity."

"Possible," Marcus admitted. "But certain defeat seems worse than possible escalation."

Kira pulled up the casualty reports again. Stared at the numbers. Twenty-three suicide attempts. Three successful. Elena Vasquez sedated. Mira Vasquez too afraid to learn.

"How do we calculate this?" she asked. "How many civilian casualties justify compromising our principles? What's the exchange rate? Ten people? A hundred? A thousand?"

"I don't know."

"Neither do I. And that terrifies me, Marcus. Because if we can't calculate it, if we can't quantify the moral math, then how do we make the decision?"

Marcus sat beside her, took her hand. His fingers were cold. "Maybe there is no calculation. Maybe there's just... choices. And consequences. And living with what we decide."

"That's not an answer."

"No. It's not."

They sat together in the quiet office, surrounded by screens full of red alerts, listening to "Mad World" drift from the break room. The world was going mad. Reality was fracturing. And they were supposed to hold it together.

"Petrov wants an answer in forty-eight hours," Marcus said.

"What are you going to tell him?"

"I don't know yet. What do you think I should tell him?"

Kira looked at the casualty reports. At Elena Vasquez's name. At Mira Vasquez's name. At the twenty-three people who'd tried to escape the chaos through death.

"I think," she said slowly, "that principles matter. But I also think people matter more. And if we have to choose between maintaining our ideological purity and ending the suffering... I don't know which choice is right. But I know which choice I can live with."

"Which?"

"The one that stops the suffering. Even if it costs us our principles. Even if it makes us what we fought against. Because principles are abstractions, Marcus. But those people in the border zones—they're real. Their pain is real. And if we can end that pain by compromising our principles... maybe that's the right choice. Or maybe it's the wrong choice. But at least it's a choice that prioritizes people over ideas."

Marcus was quiet for a long time. Then: "Six months ago, I refused to approve the seduction operation. I chose principles over pragmatism. I saved Julian Kovač by refusing to compromise."

"I remember."

"Was I right?"

"I thought so at the time."

"And now?"

Kira looked at the screens, at the flood of red alerts, at the numbers that represented real suffering. "Now I don't know. Maybe you were right. Maybe you were wrong. Maybe there is no right answer, just different kinds of wrong, and we have to choose which wrong we can live with."

Marcus stood, pulled her to her feet, wrapped her in a hug. She leaned against him, felt his heart beating, felt the warmth of another human being in the cold office.

"Whatever you decide," she said, "I'm with you. If you approve the operation, I'll help execute it. If you refuse, I'll keep fighting the defensive battle. Whatever you choose, we choose together."

"Even if it's the wrong choice?"

"Especially if it's the wrong choice. Because at least we'll be wrong together."

They stood like that for a long time, holding each other in the quiet office, surrounded by the evidence of their failing defenses, listening to the melancholy music from the break room.

*All around me are familiar faces, worn out places, worn out faces.*

The world was going mad.

And they were running out of time to stop it.

---

After Marcus left, Kira returned to her screens. Pulled up the casualty reports one more time. Read through the individual case studies. Tried to see them as people, not statistics.

Elena Vasquez. Mikhail Volkov. Mira Vasquez. Twenty-three suicide attempts. Three successful.

How many more before they acted? How many more casualties before principles became luxuries they couldn't afford?

She thought about Nikolai's question: *We're defending truth by controlling information. Isn't that what we fought against?*

And she thought about her own answer: *There's a difference between protecting verification systems and dictating what's true.*

But was there? Really? Or was that just justification? Rationalization? The story she told herself to sleep at night?

Kira didn't know anymore.

She pulled up the detection algorithm, ran another diagnostic. The numbers were worse than before. More insertions. More alerts. More backlog.

They were losing.

And in forty-eight hours, Marcus would make a decision that would define who they were. What they stood for. What they were willing to become.

Kira hoped he'd make the right choice.

She just didn't know what the right choice was anymore.
