## Summary

Six months have passed. SFW's invasion is imminent—days away, maybe hours. The border is militarized, tense, waiting. Multiple perspectives show the moment before war begins.

**Marcus Chen - Strategic Command**
Marcus stands in the command center, reviewing defensive positions. Six months of preparation. Veridica and Chronos have formed a reluctant alliance. Other Histologic nations are watching, waiting to see who wins before committing.

He thinks about the path that led here: believer, reformer, revolutionary, spy, soldier. Each transformation seemed necessary. Each cost him something.

Kira works beside him, coordinating technical defenses. They're partners in this, as they've been partners in everything. They've lost their innocence, their certainty, their faith in easy answers. But they still have each other.

Marcus thinks: *We fought with facts. We won through corruption. Now we fight with blood. And I still don't know if any of it was right.*

**Kira Osman - Technical Defense**
Kira monitors the systems. They've hardened everything against infiltration—learned from what they did to Chronos. SFW can't corrupt their factorepo the way they corrupted Chronos's.

But SFW isn't planning infiltration. They're planning invasion.

Kira thinks: *We became what we fought against to win the fact war. Now we have to defend what we became. The irony isn't lost on me.*

**Elena Volkov - Field Commander**
Elena commands a resistance unit at the border. She's done with seduction, done with infiltration. Now she's a soldier, openly fighting.

It feels cleaner than what she did to Adrian. Not clean—war is never clean—but cleaner. At least her enemies know she's their enemy.

She thinks about Adrian sometimes. Wonders if he's okay. Knows he's not. Carries that guilt into battle.

She thinks: *I destroyed a good man to win a war. Now I'm fighting to defend what I won. I don't know if I'm a hero or a villain. Maybe I'm both. Maybe we all are.*

**Alexei, Dmitri, Nikolai Volkov - Resistance Positions**
The Volkov brothers are stationed at different positions along the border. They're still divided over the Chronos operation—Alexei defends it, Dmitri condemns it, Nikolai is uncertain.

But they're fighting together anyway. Because family matters. Because Veridica matters. Because sometimes you fight alongside people you disagree with.

Alexei thinks: *We're fractured but fighting. Maybe that's enough.*

**General Yevgenia Sokolov - Military Command**
General Sokolov coordinates the defense. She has good soldiers, good positions, good intelligence. But SFW has more troops, more resources, more unity.

It will be close. It might be impossible.

She thinks: *We won the fact war and invited this invasion. Now we have to survive what we caused. That's the price of victory.*

**Isaiah Okonkwo - SFW Press Center**
Isaiah watches from SFW territory. His article helped justify this invasion. He reported truth—but truth has consequences.

He's covering the invasion as a journalist. He'll document what happens. But he knows he's partly responsible for it happening.

He thinks: *I told the truth. The truth started a war. Was I right to tell it? I'll never know.*

**Adrian Kovač - Chronos, Watching**
Adrian watches the news from his small apartment in Chronos. Veridica and Chronos are allies now—the nation that destroyed his history is now his nation's partner.

He doesn't know how to feel about that. Betrayed again? Pragmatically accepting? Numbly indifferent?

He thinks: *They destroyed me to win a war. Now they're fighting another war. Maybe war is all there is. Maybe trust was always a lie.*

**Mikhail "Old Songs" Petrov - Veridica, Resistance Hall**
Mikhail, 81 years old, sits in the resistance hall. He's too old to fight. But he can sing.

He sings for the soldiers heading to the border. He sings "We Shall Overcome," "Blowin' in the Wind," "If I Can Help Somebody." Old songs for new wars.

He thinks: *I've fought for truth for sixty years. I've seen it corrupted, weaponized, defended, attacked. And I still don't know what truth is. But I know it's worth fighting for. Even when we fail. Even when we fall.*

**Chancellor Viktor Petrov - Government Complex**
Petrov addresses the nation one final time before the invasion:

"Citizens of Veridica, we face a threat unlike any we've faced before. Not a fact war, but a blood war. Not a battle over history, but a battle for survival.

"We are not perfect. Our system is not perfect. We have made mistakes, compromised our principles, done things we regret. But we are here. We are real. We are worth defending.

"To our allies in Chronos: thank you for standing with us despite our past. To our soldiers: thank you for defending us despite our flaws. To our people: thank you for believing in us despite our failures.

"The war begins tomorrow. We may win. We may lose. But we will fight. Because the alternative is surrender. And we do not surrender."

**The Border - Final Image**
The epilogue ends at the border, multiple perspectives converging:

- Marcus and Kira in command center, watching monitors
- Elena and her unit in defensive positions
- The Volkov brothers at their stations
- General Sokolov coordinating from headquarters
- Across the border, SFW troops preparing to advance

The sun sets. The border is quiet. Everyone knows what's coming.

Marcus sends a message to the entire defense force: "We fought with facts and won. Now we fight with blood. Whatever happens tomorrow, we fight together. We fight for each other. We fight because we must."

Kira adds: "And we remember why. Not for the system. Not for the government. For the people. For each other. For the chance to build something better."

The night falls. The border waits.

Tomorrow, the invasion begins.

Tomorrow, everything changes.

Tomorrow, they discover whether winning the fact war was worth the cost.

**Final Lines:**
Marcus stands at the border, Kira beside him, watching the darkness where SFW troops wait.

He thinks: *We won the Battle of Truths. Now comes the Battle of Blood. And after that? Maybe the battle for who we want to be. If we survive.*

Kira takes his hand. "Whatever happens tomorrow, we face it together."

"Together," Marcus agrees.

Behind them, Veridica prepares. Ahead of them, war waits.

The age of fact wars is over.

The age of blood wars has begun.

And somewhere, in the darkness, the Architects watch and wait for their moment.
