**Date**: December 28-29, 2109  
**Location**: Chronos, border crossing to Veridica  
**POV**: Alexei Volkov  
**Word Count Target**: ~3,500 words

## Summary

Alexei Volkov coordinates the team's extraction from Chronos. The operation succeeded, but now they need to get out before Chronos realizes what happened and closes the borders.

**The Safe House**
Marcus, Kira, and Elena have been hiding in Alexei's safe house since the infiltration. They've monitored the restoration, watched Chronos accept the new history, seen the operation succeed.

But success doesn't feel like victory.

Elena has been silent for days, barely eating, staring at nothing. Kira works obsessively on cleaning their digital traces. Marcus reviews intelligence reports, watching for signs of discovery.

Alexei tells them: "We need to leave. Tonight. Chen Wei is investigating. He's smart. He'll figure it out soon if he hasn't already."

**The Plan**
Extraction route: underground resistance networks, forged travel documents, multiple border crossings, misdirection. They'll split up, take different routes, reunite in Veridica.

Dmitri will provide security, running interference if they're pursued. Alexei will guide them through the first stage. After that, they're on their own.

Alexei briefs them: "The borders are still open, but that could change. If Chronos realizes what happened, they'll lock down everything. We have maybe 24 hours."

**The Departure**
They leave the safe house at midnight. Elena takes one last look at Chronos—the city where she destroyed a good man. She thinks about Adrian, probably in his apartment, maybe starting to realize the truth.

She thinks: *I should have warned him. I should have told him something. But that would have compromised the mission.*

She wonders if the mission was worth it.

**The Close Call**
At the first checkpoint, they encounter Chronos security conducting random searches. Marcus and Kira pass through with forged documents. But Elena is flagged—her cover identity is on a watch list.

Security officer: "Dr. Sokolov, please step aside for additional screening."

Elena's training kicks in. She plays confused academic: "Is there a problem? I have a flight to catch—"

"Routine screening. It will only take a moment."

Dmitri creates a distraction: a staged argument with another traveler, drawing security's attention. In the confusion, Alexei hustles Elena through a service exit.

They're out. But it was close.

**The Pursuit**
As they move through the city toward the border, Alexei gets word: Chen Wei has issued a quiet alert for "Dr. Elena Sokolov and associates." Not public, not official, but security forces are watching.

They abandon the planned route, take underground passages through the resistance network. It's slower, more dangerous, but less monitored.

**The Confrontation**
At a resistance waypoint, they encounter Julian Kovač.

He's there. Waiting. He somehow tracked them—maybe through Elena's communication patterns, maybe through desperation and luck.

He looks at Elena. She looks at him.

Adrian: "I needed to see you. To understand."

Elena: "Adrian, I'm sorry—"

"Don't. Don't apologize. Just tell me: was any of it real?"

Elena wants to lie, to make it easier for him. But she owes him truth, even if it's painful.

"Some of it. Not enough. But some."

"Which parts?"

"I don't know anymore. I'm sorry."

Adrian looks at Marcus. "You. You're Marcus Chen, aren't you? The one who saved me six months ago?"

Marcus: "Yes."

"Why? Why save me just to destroy me?"

"I didn't plan this then. The world changed. The fact war forced my hand."

"So you used your previous kindness as setup for betrayal?"

"No. I saved you because it was right. I destroyed you because I thought I had no choice. Both are true."

Adrian laughs bitterly. "You taught me that trust matters more than protocol. That principles are worth the risk. And then you used those lessons to destroy me."

Marcus has no answer. Because Adrian is right.

**The Departure**
Alexei interrupts: "We need to move. Security is closing in."

Adrian doesn't try to stop them. What would be the point? The operation succeeded. His nation's history is already replaced. Stopping them now changes nothing.

He looks at Elena one last time. "I hope it was worth it. I hope whatever you won was worth what you destroyed."

Elena: "I don't think it was. But I did it anyway."

They leave. Adrian stands alone in the waypoint, watching them go.

**The Border**
They reach the Veridica border at dawn. Dmitri has secured their crossing. They pass through—officially, they're Veridica citizens returning from research trips.

As they cross, Kira looks back at Chronos. "We just conquered a nation. And we're going home as heroes."

Marcus: "We're not heroes."

Elena: "No. We're not."

The chapter ends with them in Veridica, safe, successful, and completely hollowed out by what they've done.

Behind them, in Chronos, Julian Kovač returns to his apartment to live with the consequences of trust.
