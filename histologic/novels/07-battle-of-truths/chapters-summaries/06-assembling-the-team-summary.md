**Date**: Late October 2109  
**Location**: Various locations in Veridica  
**POV**: Marcus Chen  
**Word Count Target**: ~4,000 words

## Summary

Marcus begins recruiting his team, knowing each conversation will be difficult. He needs people with specific skills and absolute trust—but he also needs people willing to compromise their principles.

**Recruitment 1: Elena Volkov**
Marcus meets Elena at a resistance safe house. She's been running semi-legitimate operations since the distributed truth transformation, helping refugees and coordinating information networks. He explains the operation.

Elena listens without expression. When he finishes, she says: "You're asking me to seduce someone. To make them fall in love with me, gain their trust, and destroy them."

"Yes."

"Six months ago, you refused to let me do exactly this. You said it was wrong. You said we'd find another way."

"I was wrong. There is no other way."

Elena studies him. "You've changed, Marcus. You used to believe in absolute principles. Now you're calculating costs and benefits."

"The world changed me. The fact war changed me. Watching civilians suffer changed me."

Elena is quiet for a moment, then: "I'll do it. Not because I think it's right—I don't. But because someone has to, and I'm good at it. Better me than someone who'll feel guilty afterward."

Marcus isn't sure if that's reassuring or disturbing.

**Recruitment 2: Kira Osman**
This is the hardest conversation. Kira is his partner, his conscience, his moral anchor. They meet in their apartment, late at night.

He explains the plan. Kira's face goes pale.

"Marcus, no. This is exactly what we fought against. This is what Wei did. What the Architects do."

"I know."

"Then why?"

"Because defensive purity means watching Veridica fall. Because civilians are suffering. Because sometimes the right thing is impossible, and we have to choose the least wrong thing."

Kira is silent for a long time. Finally: "If I help you do this, I'm complicit. If I don't help, I'm complicit in what happens to those civilians. There's no clean choice, is there?"

"No. There isn't."

"I hate this, Marcus. I hate that you're asking. I hate that I'm going to say yes. I hate that we've been forced into this position."

"I know. I'm sorry."

"Don't apologize. Just... promise me this is the last time. Promise me we don't become people who do this casually."

"I promise."

She doesn't look convinced, but she agrees.

**Recruitment 3: Nikolai Volkov**
Nikolai is the technical expert they need for infiltration. Marcus meets him at the Commission offices.

Nikolai listens to the plan, then laughs bitterly. "You want me to help you corrupt a factorepo. The exact thing I spent years fighting against."

"Yes."

"And you think this is different because we're the good guys?"

"No. I think it's the same. But I think it's necessary anyway."

Nikolai considers this. "At least you're honest about it. Most people doing evil things convince themselves they're righteous. You know you're compromising, and you're doing it anyway."

"Does that make it better or worse?"

"I don't know. But I'll help. Not because I think it's right, but because I think Chronos winning would be worse. And because if someone's going to do this, it should be someone who understands the cost."

**Brief Recruitment Mentions:**
- **Alexei Volkov**: Agrees to provide ground support in Chronos
- **Dmitri Volkov**: Agrees to provide security
- **Others**: Small team of technical specialists

The chapter ends with Marcus alone in his office, looking at photos of his team. Good people, all of them. And he's asking them to become something else. He thinks of an old phrase from the 20th century: "The road to hell is paved with good intentions."

He wonders if that's where they're headed.
