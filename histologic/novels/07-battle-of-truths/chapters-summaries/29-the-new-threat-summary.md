# Chapter 29: The New Threat

**Date**: May 2110  
**Location**: Veridica, Military Intelligence headquarters  
**POV**: General Yevgenia Sokolov  
**Word Count Target**: ~3,500 words

## Summary

General Yevgenia Sokolov (promoted from Captain, last seen in "The Divided Truth") is now head of Veridica Military Intelligence. She's been monitoring SFW military activity, and what she sees terrifies her.

**The Intelligence**
General Sokolov briefs Chancellor Petrov and the defense council:

"SFW is mobilizing for war. Not preparing—mobilizing. They're moving troops to the border, stockpiling supplies, running invasion simulations. Timeline: 6-12 months until they're ready to attack."

The council is skeptical: "SFW has always been hostile. This might be posturing."

Sokolov: "No. This is different. They're not posturing—they're preparing. And they're doing it because they think we're weak."

"Why would they think that?"

"Because of the fact war. Because of Isaiah Okonkwo's article. Because we proved that Histologic systems can be corrupted, that we're divided, that we fight each other instead of external threats."

**The Strategic Assessment**
Sokolov presents her analysis:

**SFW's Perspective:**
- Histologic nations are distracted by fact wars
- Their systems are vulnerable to infiltration
- They're divided (Veridica vs. Chronos)
- They've proven they'll corrupt their own principles
- They look weak, not strong

**SFW's Advantages:**
- Larger military (250 million population)
- Religious unity (strong morale)
- No dependence on corruptible systems
- International sympathy (after Isaiah's article)

**Veridica's Vulnerabilities:**
- Just fought a fact war (resources depleted)
- Relationship with Chronos damaged
- Internal resistance divided
- International reputation as corruptible
- No allies prepared to help

**The Worst Part:**
"We won the fact war. But in doing so, we made ourselves look like the perfect target. SFW sees us as technologically advanced but systemically vulnerable. They think they can win."

**The Debate**
Chancellor Petrov asks: "Can we win a conventional war with SFW?"

Sokolov: "Alone? No. With Chronos as ally? Maybe. With all Histologic nations united? Yes."

"Will Chronos ally with us after what we did to them?"

"I don't know. But we need to try."

Defense Minister: "What if we're wrong? What if SFW isn't planning invasion?"

Sokolov: "Then we've wasted resources on preparation. But if we're right and we don't prepare, we lose everything."

**The Personal**
After the briefing, Sokolov meets privately with Marcus Chen. They've worked together since "The Divided Truth"—she respects him, even if she doesn't always agree with him.

"Marcus, I need you to understand something. The operation you ran against Chronos? It worked. You ended the fact war. You saved civilian lives. You protected Veridica."

"But?"

"But you also made us look weak. You proved we're willing to corrupt our own systems. You gave SFW the justification they needed to attack."

Marcus is quiet. "I didn't think about external threats. I was focused on ending the fact war."

"I know. But that's the problem with covert operations—you solve one problem and create another."

"So what do we do?"

"We prepare for war. Real war. Not fact war, but blood war. And we need you."

**The Recruitment**
Sokolov explains: "SFW will invade within a year. When they do, we'll need everyone. Soldiers, intelligence operatives, strategists. People who understand both Histologic and non-Histologic thinking."

"You want me to fight?"

"I want you to help us survive. You've proven you're willing to do what's necessary, even when it costs you. We need that."

Marcus: "I'm done with covert operations. I'm done with corruption."

"This won't be covert. This will be open war. Defense, not deception."

"And if defense requires deception?"

Sokolov is honest: "Then we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. But right now, we need to prepare for invasion. Will you help?"

Marcus looks at her. He's exhausted, guilty, morally compromised. But he's also committed to protecting Veridica.

"One more time. But this time, we do it right. No lies, no deception, no corruption."

"I can't promise that. War requires compromise."

"Then I can't promise I'll stay. But I'll start. And we'll see where it goes."

**The Preparation**
Sokolov begins mobilizing Veridica's defenses:

- Military training intensifies
- Border fortifications begin
- Intelligence gathering on SFW increases
- Diplomatic outreach to potential allies
- Civil defense preparations

She briefs the public carefully: "We're enhancing our defensive capabilities in response to regional instability." No mention of imminent invasion—that would cause panic.

**The Alliance Question**
The biggest question: Can Veridica ally with Chronos?

Sokolov sends a back-channel message to Minister Petra Sokolov (no relation) in Chronos: "We have a common threat. SFW is mobilizing. They'll come for you after they come for us. We need to talk."

Petra's response: "We know what you did to us. Why would we ally with you?"

"Because the alternative is losing separately instead of winning together."

"We'll consider it."

It's not a yes. But it's not a no.

**The Warning**
The chapter ends with Sokolov standing at the border, looking toward SFW territory. She can see their military installations, their troop movements, their preparations.

She thinks: *We won the fact war. But we're about to lose something much worse. We proved we could corrupt truth. Now we have to prove we can defend it.*

She sends a final message to Marcus: "The age of fact wars is over. The age of blood wars is beginning. Are you ready?"

Marcus's response: "No. But I'll fight anyway."
