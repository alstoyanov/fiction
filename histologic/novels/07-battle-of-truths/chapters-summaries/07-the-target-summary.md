# Chapter 7: The Target

**Date**: Early November 2109  
**Location**: Veridica, Intelligence briefing room  
**POV**: Elena Volkov  
**Word Count Target**: ~3,500 words

## Summary

Elena sits in a secure briefing room, reviewing dossiers of potential targets in Chronos. She needs someone with high-level factorepo access, someone vulnerable to seduction, someone whose compromise won't trigger immediate security alerts.

She reviews three candidates:
1. **Director Chen Wei**: Too paranoid, too security-conscious
2. **Minister Petra Sokolov**: Too high-profile, too well-protected
3. **Adrian Kovač**: Senior Historian, factorepo access, recently widowed, idealistic, vulnerable

Elena studies Adrian's file. Age 39. Wife died two years ago. No children. Devoted to his work. Distributed truth advocate—he was the target of a similar operation six months ago, but Marcus Chen refused to execute it, saving him. Adrian became grateful, even friendly with Marcus through back-channel communications.

The irony isn't lost on Elena: Marcus saved this man by refusing to corrupt him. Now Marcus is asking Elena to destroy him.

She reviews Adrian's psychological profile: lonely, idealistic, craves intellectual connection, believes in the nobility of historical work, vulnerable to someone who shares his passion. He's recently been expressing doubts about Chronos's fact warfare tactics—which makes him both perfect target and tragic victim.

Elena creates her cover identity: Dr. Elena Volkov becomes "Dr. Elena Sokolov," an independent historian from Synthesis (neutral nation), researching cross-national historical methodologies. She'll "accidentally" meet Adrian at an upcoming international conference on historical verification.

She plans the approach: intellectual connection first, shared passion for history, gradual personal intimacy, eventual romantic relationship. Timeline: 6-8 weeks from first contact to obtaining access credentials.

Marcus joins her for the briefing. He looks at Adrian's photo and flinches.

"I saved him," Marcus says quietly. "Six months ago, I chose not to do this to him. I thought I was being principled. Now I'm asking you to finish what I refused to start."

Elena looks at him steadily. "You want to back out? We can find another target."

"No. He's perfect. He has the access, the vulnerability, the trust. Because of me, he trusts reformers. He'll trust you."

"That makes it worse, doesn't it? That he'll trust me because of you."

"Yes. It makes it much worse."

Elena closes the dossier. "He's a good man, Marcus. From everything I'm reading, he's genuinely principled. He's questioning the fact war because it harms people. He's exactly the kind of person we should be allying with, not destroying."

"I know."

"And we're going to destroy him anyway."

"Yes."

Elena stands. "Then let's be clear about what we're doing. We're not saving Veridica. We're not defending truth. We're sacrificing a good man to win a war. Let's not dress it up as anything noble."

Marcus nods. "Agreed. No noble lies. We're doing something terrible for practical reasons. That's all."

The chapter ends with Elena beginning her preparation: learning Adrian's research interests, memorizing his published papers, studying his mannerisms from video footage. She's done this before—seduction as weapon—but never to someone who didn't deserve it.

She wonders if that matters. Probably not. But she wonders anyway.
