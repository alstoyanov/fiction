# Chapter 5: The Desperate Plan

**Date**: Late October 2109  
**Location**: Veridica, Chancellor's Office  
**POV**: Marcus Chen  
**Word Count Target**: ~4,000 words

## Summary

Marcus requests an urgent meeting with Chancellor Viktor Petrov. He arrives at the government complex, passing through multiple security checkpoints. The weight of what he's about to propose sits heavy on him.

In Petrov's office, Marcus presents his analysis: Veridica is losing the fact war. Within three months, their historical integrity will be compromised beyond repair. Defensive measures aren't working. The civilian cost is mounting daily.

Petrov asks: "What do you propose?"

Marcus takes a breath and explains: "We end it. Not by defending better, but by making it impossible for Chronos to continue. We replace their factorepo backup with our version of history. Force a system failure, they restore from backup, and suddenly they're operating on our historical framework."

Silence. Petrov stares at him.

"That's... audacious. And completely illegal under international Histologic protocols."

"So is what they're doing to us, Chancellor. So is what they're doing to civilians in the border zones."

Marcus explains the technical feasibility. It's the same operation he refused to execute six months ago—the one that would have targeted Julian Kovač. He saved Adrian then by choosing transparency over corruption. Now he's proposing to execute that exact operation.

Petrov asks the key question: "What would this cost us? Morally, I mean."

Marcus is honest: "Everything we fought for. We'd become what we opposed. We'd prove that distributed truth advocates are willing to use centralized control when it suits us. We'd corrupt the system we're trying to protect."

"And if we don't?"

"Chronos wins. Distributed truth fails. And the next fact war will be even worse."

Petrov walks to his window, looking out over Veridica's capital. He's silent for a long time. Finally: "I can't officially authorize this. The Council would never approve. International observers would condemn us. But..."

He turns to Marcus: "I also can't let Veridica fall. I can't watch our citizens suffer while we maintain ideological purity. So here's what I'll say: I know nothing about this. If you proceed, you do so without official sanction. If you succeed, I'll claim diplomatic breakthrough. If you fail, I'll claim rogue operation. Understood?"

Marcus understands perfectly. Plausible deniability. The Chancellor is giving tacit approval while maintaining official distance.

"You'll need a team," Petrov says. "People you trust absolutely. People who understand what this will cost."

Marcus nods. He already knows who to recruit.

As Marcus leaves, Petrov calls after him: "Marcus? For what it's worth... I'm sorry it came to this. You deserved better than to be forced into this choice."

Marcus pauses at the door. "We all did, Chancellor. But this is the world we have, not the world we wanted."

The chapter ends with Marcus walking through Veridica's streets, looking at ordinary people going about their lives, unaware that their defender is about to become their corruptor.
