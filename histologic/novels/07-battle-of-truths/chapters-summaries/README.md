## Tragic Irony

**The Core Tragedy**: In Novel 6 ("The Distributed Truth"), Marcus REFUSED to execute this exact operation on Adrian Kovač, choosing transparency over corruption. He SAVED Adrian by refusing. Now in Novel 7, Marcus must execute that same operation, DESTROYING the man he saved. Adrian trusted Marcus's lesson about trust—and that trust was weaponized against him.

- **Elena's guilt**: Show her internal conflict throughout
- **Adrian's tragedy**: Make him genuinely good, making betrayal worse
- **Pacing**: Part Two (seduction) should be slower, intimate; Part Three (catastrophe) should be fast, tense
- **Moral ambiguity**: No easy answers, no clear heroes or villains
- **Connections**: Reference previous novels, set up Novel 8
