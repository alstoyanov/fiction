**Word Count Target**: ~4,000 words

## Summary

Elena arrives in Geneva for the International Historical Verification Conference, held in neutral territory. She's traveling as "Dr. Elena Sokolov" from Synthesis, complete with forged credentials, published papers (actually written by Kira under the pseudonym), and a carefully constructed academic reputation.

The conference brings together historians from all Histologic nations to discuss verification methodologies—ironic, given the ongoing fact war. But diplomatic protocols still hold, and the conference proceeds.

Elena spots Julian Kovač across the conference hall. He's presenting a paper on "Ethical Constraints in Historical Verification." She attends his presentation, sitting in the front row, taking detailed notes.

Adrian's presentation is impressive—he argues that historical verification must serve truth, not national interests. He criticizes fact warfare (carefully, without naming nations) as a corruption of historical methodology. His passion is genuine, his arguments compelling.

During Q&A, Elena asks an insightful question about verification in distributed truth systems. Adrian's face lights up—finally, someone who understands the nuances. They have a brief exchange that's intellectually electric.

After the session, Elena "accidentally" encounters Adrian at the coffee station. She introduces herself, mentions she found his presentation fascinating. They talk for twenty minutes about historical methodology, distributed truth systems, the ethics of verification.

Adrian is clearly interested—not romantically yet, but intellectually engaged. He says: "Most people at these conferences are defending their nation's approach. You're actually interested in finding what works."

Elena smiles. "Truth doesn't care about borders, Dr. Kovač. Neither should historians."

He invites her to dinner—"Just to continue the conversation." She accepts, playing slightly hesitant, not too eager.

At dinner, they talk for three hours. Adrian tells her about his work, his frustrations with Chronos's fact warfare tactics, his belief that distributed truth might be the future. He mentions Marcus Chen—"A Veridica reformer who saved me from a terrible mistake six months ago. He showed me that principles matter more than national interests."

Elena feels a twist of guilt but hides it perfectly. "He sounds like a good man."

"He is. I hope to meet him in person someday, thank him properly."

Elena thinks: *You trusted Marcus. Now you'll trust me because of him. And we'll destroy you with that trust.*

But she says: "I'd like to meet him too. Anyone who puts principles first deserves respect."

The evening ends with Adrian asking if she'll be at tomorrow's sessions. She will. They agree to have coffee, continue their discussions.

As Elena returns to her hotel, she sends an encrypted message to Marcus: "First contact successful. He's exactly as vulnerable as we thought. And exactly as good as we feared."

The chapter ends with Elena looking at herself in the mirror, preparing for the next day's performance. She's done this before. She'll do it again. But for the first time in years, she wonders if there's a cost she's not calculating.
