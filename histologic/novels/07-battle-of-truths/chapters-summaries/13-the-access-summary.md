## Summary

Adrian invites Elena to his home for dinner. It's been a month since they met, two weeks since they became intimate. He's happier than he's been in years. He's even told his colleagues he's seeing someone—Minister Sokolov smiled and said, "It's about time, Adrian."

Over dinner, Elena mentions her research has hit a wall. She needs access to certain classified historical archives—records of the Border Wars, verification protocols, backup system documentation. It's all for her paper on cross-national historical methodologies.

Adrian hesitates. "Those archives are restricted. I'd need to give you my credentials."

"I understand. I shouldn't have asked."

But Adrian thinks about it. Elena is a serious scholar. She's from a neutral nation. She's not involved in the fact war. And more importantly: he trusts her. Completely.

He remembers Marcus Chen's lesson: sometimes doing the right thing means trusting good people, even when protocols say otherwise. Marcus trusted him six months ago, refused to compromise him. That trust changed Adrian's life.

Now Adrian wants to pay it forward. Elena is good people. She deserves trust.

"I'll give you access," he says. "But you have to promise me—only for research. Only what you need. And you protect my credentials."

Elena looks moved. "Adrian, I can't ask you to break protocol for me."

"You're not asking. I'm offering. Because I trust you. Because sometimes trust matters more than protocol."

He gives her his access credentials, shows her how to use them, explains which systems she can access. He even gives her a tour of the factorepo facility (as his guest, with proper visitor protocols).

Elena memorizes everything: security checkpoints, guard rotations, system access points, backup server locations. Adrian thinks she's just interested in the architecture. He has no idea she's mapping the target.

That evening, back at his apartment, they make love. Afterward, Adrian holds her and says: "Thank you for being in my life. I didn't think I'd feel this way again after losing my wife. You've given me hope."

Elena holds him tighter, hiding her face. "You've given me something too, Adrian. Something I didn't expect."

He thinks she means love. She means guilt.

**The Philosophical Conversation**
Later, they have wine and talk about truth and trust. Adrian says: "The fact war is wrong because it treats truth as a weapon. But truth should be something we share, not something we fight over. That's what Marcus Chen taught me—that transparency and trust are more powerful than control and deception."

Elena asks: "What if trust is betrayed? What if transparency is weaponized?"

"Then the person who betrayed trust has to live with that. But I'd rather be someone who trusted and was betrayed than someone who never trusted at all."

Elena is quiet for a long time. Finally: "You're a better person than most, Adrian."

"I'm just trying to be worthy of the trust people put in me. Like Marcus's trust. Like yours."

Elena excuses herself, goes to the bathroom, and stares at herself in the mirror. She thinks: *He trusts me because Marcus taught him to trust. We're destroying him with the very principle that makes him good.*

She composes herself and returns. Adrian is looking at old photos of his wife. He shows Elena: "She would have liked you. She always said I needed someone who challenged my thinking."

Elena looks at the photo of a smiling woman, dead two years. She thinks: *I'm using her death to manipulate him. I'm using his grief as a weapon.*

But she says: "She was beautiful. You must have loved her very much."

"I did. I do. But I'm learning that loving someone who's gone doesn't mean I can't love someone who's here."

The chapter ends with Adrian falling asleep, peaceful and trusting. Elena lies awake beside him, his access credentials memorized, the facility layout mapped in her mind. She has everything she needs to destroy him.

She thinks: *I'm sorry, Adrian. I'm so sorry. But I'm going to do it anyway.*
