# Chapter 3: The Commission Responds

**Date**: October 2109  
**Location**: Veridica, Historical Integrity Commission  
**POV**: Kira Osman  
**Word Count Target**: ~3,500 words

## Summary

Kira Osman works late at the Historical Integrity Commission, analyzing the flood of contradictory facts being inserted by Chronos. She's developed sophisticated detection algorithms, but they're overwhelmed. The system flags thousands of suspicious entries daily, but verification takes time—time they don't have.

She meets with her technical team, including Nikolai Volkov (now Senior Systems Architect). They review the data: Chronos is targeting foundational historical events. If they succeed in rewriting major events, the entire historical framework becomes unstable.

Kira implements counter-measures: quarantining suspicious facts, fast-tracking verification, strengthening distributed truth networks. But it's like fighting a flood with buckets. For every fact they verify and protect, Chronos inserts ten more contradictions.

She has a philosophical conversation with Nikolai about the nature of their work. He says: "We're defending truth by controlling information. Isn't that what we fought against?" Kira responds: "We're defending the *process* of truth-finding. There's a difference between protecting verification systems and dictating what's true."

But she's not sure she believes her own argument anymore.

Kira reviews casualty reports from the border regions—mental health crises, family breakdowns, cognitive dissonance disorders. The fact war is harming real people. She thinks of Elena Vasquez (from Prologue) and thousands like her.

She meets with Marcus in the evening. They're both exhausted. She tells him: "We're losing, Marcus. Not slowly—quickly. Within months, Veridica's historical integrity will be compromised beyond repair."

Marcus asks: "What if we went on offense?"

Kira knows what he means. She's been expecting this conversation. "That would make us like them."

"Or it would end the war before more people get hurt."

Kira doesn't have an answer. The chapter ends with her looking at the casualty reports, trying to calculate the moral math: How many civilian casualties justify compromising their principles?
