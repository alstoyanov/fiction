# Prologue: The Border Fracture

**Date**: September 2109  
**Location**: Veridica-Chronos border zone  
**POV**: Civilian (Elena Vasquez, border resident)  
**Word Count Target**: ~2,000 words

## Summary

Elena Vasquez lives in the border zone between Veridica and Chronos, where reality itself has become unstable. Six months after the peaceful distributed truth transformation, hardliners in Chronos have begun inserting contradictory facts into the shared historical record. The street where Elena lives flickers between two names: "Liberation Avenue" (Veridica's version) and "Unity Boulevard" (Chronos's version). Historical monuments appear and disappear. Her children come home from school confused—today they learned that the Border Wars ended in 2087 with Veridica's victory, but yesterday they learned Chronos won.

Elena experiences cognitive dissonance so severe she can barely function. Which history is real? Both? Neither? The Judge in Veridica confirms one version; The Judge in Chronos confirms another. Her husband, a Chronos citizen, remembers events differently than she does. They argue about what happened at their wedding—even their personal history is fracturing.

The psychological warfare is devastating. Border residents are developing mental health crises. Some have stopped trusting their own memories. Others have chosen one version of reality and cling to it desperately, refusing to acknowledge alternatives. Families are splitting apart over which facts to believe.

Elena stands at her window, watching the street sign flicker between names, and wonders: "Is this what war looks like now? Not bombs and bullets, but reality itself becoming a weapon?"
