**Word Count Target**: ~3,000 words

## Summary

This chapter presents multiple short vignettes showing how the fact war affects ordinary people:

**Vignette 1: The Teacher (Veridica side)**
Maria teaches history to middle school students. Each morning, she checks which version of history The Judge currently confirms. Today, the Border Wars ended in 2087 with a peace treaty. Yesterday, Veridica won decisively. Tomorrow, who knows? Her students are confused and angry. "Why can't you just tell us what really happened?" She doesn't have an answer.

**Vignette 2: The Family (Border zone)**
The Kowalski family is splitting apart. Father (Chronos citizen) and mother (Veridica citizen) can't agree on basic facts anymore. Their teenage daughter has stopped believing anything. "If even history can be fake, what's real?" She's developed severe anxiety and stopped attending school.

**Vignette 3: The Veteran (Chronos side)**
Colonel Dmitri Volkov (retired) fought in the Border Wars. He knows what happened—he was there. But now The Judge says events happened differently. His own memories contradict official records. Is he going crazy? Did he imagine his service? His therapist says he's experiencing "factual dissonance disorder"—a new diagnosis for fact war casualties.

**Vignette 4: The Historian (Neutral observer)**
Dr. Sarah Chen (no relation to Marcus) works at a university in Synthesis, a neutral Histologic nation. She watches both Veridica and Chronos rewrite history in real-time. She's writing a paper titled "The Death of Historical Truth in the Age of Fact Warfare." She concludes: "When history becomes a weapon, everyone loses—including those who think they're winning."

**Vignette 5: The Child (Border zone)**
Ten-year-old Alexei doesn't understand why his grandfather's war memorial keeps disappearing and reappearing. Sometimes it says "Heroes of the Liberation." Sometimes it says "Victims of Aggression." Sometimes it's not there at all. He asks his mother: "Did Grandpa really exist?" She starts crying and can't answer.

The chapter ends with a montage: thousands of people across the border regions experiencing similar confusion, trauma, and breakdown. The fact war's casualties aren't counted in deaths—they're counted in shattered certainties, broken families, and lost faith in reality itself.
