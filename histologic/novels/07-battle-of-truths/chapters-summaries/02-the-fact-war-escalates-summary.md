# Chapter 2: The Fact War Escalates

**Date**: October 2109  
**Location**: Chronos, Ministry of Historical Defense  
**POV**: Minister Petra Sokolov  
**Word Count Target**: ~3,500 words

## Summary

Minister Petra Sokolov coordinates Chronos's fact warfare operations from her office in the capital. From her perspective, Veridica started this conflict by implementing "distributed truth" networks that undermine The Judge's authority. She sees the distributed truth movement as existential threat—if multiple truths can coexist, then Chronos's centralized certainty loses legitimacy.

Petra reviews her strategy: insert contradictory facts about key historical events, particularly border disputes and the Border Wars of 2067. Make Veridica's citizens doubt their own history. Create enough uncertainty that Veridica's government loses credibility.

She meets with her technical team, including Director Chen Wei (Security) and Julian Kovač (Senior Historian). Julian expresses discomfort with the operation—he's become a distributed truth advocate after Marcus Chen saved him from a similar operation six months ago. He argues that fact warfare harms civilians and undermines both nations' credibility.

Petra dismisses his concerns: "Veridica chose this path when they abandoned singular truth. We're defending certainty itself."

She reviews **Foundation Fragment: Principle Two** (discovered in Chronos's archives), which justifies controlled conflict between Histologic nations as a stabilizing force. This validates her strategy—the Foundation itself anticipated and approved of fact warfare.

Petra plans a major offensive: rewrite the history of the Great Lakes region, claiming Chronos has always controlled the disputed territory. Insert facts about Veridica's historical aggression. Make it look like Veridica has been the aggressor all along.

She assigns Julian to lead the historical research team, despite his reservations. "You're our best historian. I need you on this."

The chapter ends with Petra looking at a map of the border region, planning her next moves. She doesn't see herself as villain—she's defending her nation's right to historical certainty against Veridica's dangerous relativism.
