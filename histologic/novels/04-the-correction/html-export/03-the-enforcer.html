        <article class="chapter-content">
            <h1>Chapter 3: The Enforcer</h1>
<h2>POV: Dmitri Volkov</h2>
<p>Dmitri had spent three years hunting his brother. Three years tracking Alexei across borders, through safe houses, following digital breadcrumbs and whispered rumors. Three years of duty over love, law over family, system over blood.</p>
<p>And now they sat across from each other in a correction facility, both convicted, both imprisoned, both labeled as threats.</p>
<p>The irony would be funny if it didn't hurt so much.</p>
<p>"You're staring," Alexei said without looking up from his breakfast. They were in the dining hall, morning light streaming through windows that were beautiful and barred.</p>
<p>"I'm observing," Dmitri corrected.</p>
<p>"You're brooding." Alexei finally met his eyes, and Dmitri saw something he hadn't expected: concern. "You've been brooding for three days. Since the library meeting."</p>
<p>"I'm thinking."</p>
<p>"About?"</p>
<p>"About how I spent three years trying to stop you, and now I'm helping you plan an escape."</p>
<p>Alexei's expression softened. "You're not helping me, Dmitri. You're helping us. All eight of us. There's a difference."</p>
<p>"Is there?" Dmitri pushed his food around his plate. "I was an enforcer. I believed in the system. I hunted people like you because I thought I was protecting society. Protecting truth. Protecting—"</p>
<p>"Order," Alexei finished. "You always loved order. Even as kids. Everything in its place, everything following rules."</p>
<p>"Rules keep people safe."</p>
<p>"Rules keep people controlled." Alexei leaned forward. "Dmitri, I know this is hard for you. I know everything you believed is being challenged. But you have to ask yourself: were you protecting truth, or were you protecting lies?"</p>
<p>Dmitri's hands clenched into fists. "I did my duty."</p>
<p>"I know you did. That's why they convicted you anyway." Alexei's voice gentled. "They convicted you because you're too good at your job. You know too much about how enforcement works. You're dangerous to them, brother. Just like the rest of us."</p>
<p>The word <em>brother</em> hit Dmitri like a physical blow. How long since he'd allowed himself to think of Alexei that way? How many years had he forced himself to see only the outlaw, the criminal, the target?</p>
<p>"I tried to stop you," Dmitri said quietly. "I nearly caught you twice."</p>
<p>"I know. You almost had me in Chronos. That was good work."</p>
<p>"You're complimenting me for hunting you?"</p>
<p>"I'm acknowledging your skill." Alexei smiled slightly. "We're brothers, Dmitri. We're always going to compete. But we don't have to be enemies."</p>
<p>"The system says—"</p>
<p>"The system is corrupt." Alexei's voice hardened. "The system convicted you for doing your duty. The system put us in the same facility, probably hoping we'd destroy each other. The system is using us, Dmitri. When are you going to see that?"</p>
<p>Dmitri wanted to argue, wanted to defend the order he'd dedicated his life to. But the evidence was undeniable. Same conviction time. Same judge signature. Same targeted imprisonment.</p>
<p>"I see it," he admitted. "I just don't know what to do about it."</p>
<p>"You help us escape. You use your knowledge of security protocols to get us out. You protect your brothers." Alexei paused. "And maybe, after we're free, you figure out what you actually believe in. Not what you were trained to believe. What you choose to believe."</p>
<p>Before Dmitri could respond, Nikolai slid into the seat beside him. Their third brother, the mediator, the one who'd always tried to keep them together.</p>
<p>"Morning," Nikolai said, his voice tight with anxiety. "We have a problem."</p>
<p>"What kind of problem?" Dmitri asked, immediately alert.</p>
<p>"Dr. Reeves requested individual sessions with each of us. Starting today. Starting with you, Dmitri."</p>
<p>Dmitri's blood ran cold. Individual sessions meant isolation. Meant they could work on each inmate separately, break them down, extract information.</p>
<p>"When?"</p>
<p>"1000 hours. His office."</p>
<p>Alexei cursed quietly. "They're moving faster than we thought."</p>
<p>"What do I do?" Dmitri asked, hating the uncertainty in his voice. He was used to having orders, protocols, clear directives.</p>
<p>"You play the role," Alexei said immediately. "You're the conflicted enforcer. You did your duty, you don't understand why you're here, you want to be corrected so you can return to service."</p>
<p>"That's not entirely a lie," Dmitri admitted.</p>
<p>"Good. Use that." Alexei glanced around, lowered his voice. "But don't tell him anything about our meetings. Don't mention the evidence. Act confused, compliant, eager to please."</p>
<p>"I don't know if I can lie convincingly."</p>
<p>"You don't have to lie," Nikolai said softly. "You just have to not tell the whole truth. You're good at compartmentalizing, Dmitri. You always have been. Compartmentalize this."</p>
<p>Dmitri nodded slowly. He could do that. He'd spent three years compartmentalizing his feelings about hunting Alexei. He could compartmentalize for a few more days.</p>
<p>"What about the rest of you?" he asked.</p>
<p>"We'll all have sessions eventually," Nikolai said. "We need to coordinate our stories. Make sure we're not contradicting each other."</p>
<p>"Library meeting tonight?" Alexei suggested.</p>
<p>"Too soon," Dmitri said, his tactical mind engaging. "They'll be watching us more closely after individual sessions start. We need to wait. Act normal. Give them no reason to suspect."</p>
<p>"How long?"</p>
<p>"Three days. Like Kira said. We stick to the schedule."</p>
<hr />
<p>At 1000 hours, Dmitri stood outside Dr. Reeves's office. The door was brass-plated, gleaming, with the facility's motto engraved: <em>"Truth Through Correction."</em></p>
<p>He'd believed that once. Maybe part of him still did.</p>
<p>The door opened. Dr. Reeves stood there, sharp-featured and assessing.</p>
<p>"Dmitri Volkov. Please, come in."</p>
<p>The office was smaller than Dmitri expected. A desk, two chairs, walls lined with books on psychology and neural correction. A brass clock ticked on the wall—always ticking, always counting, always reminding them that time was measured and controlled.</p>
<p>"Sit," Reeves said, not unkindly.</p>
<p>Dmitri sat, back straight, hands on knees. Military posture. Enforcer posture.</p>
<p>Reeves noticed. "You maintain discipline even here. That's good. It shows the core of who you are hasn't been corrupted."</p>
<p>"I did my duty," Dmitri said. The phrase was becoming a mantra.</p>
<p>"You did. Your record is exemplary. Three years tracking your brother. Multiple near-captures. You never wavered, never showed mercy, never let family loyalty compromise your mission." Reeves leaned forward. "So why did they convict you?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Dmitri said honestly.</p>
<p>"Don't you? Think, Dmitri. What changed? What made them decide you were compromised?"</p>
<p>Dmitri thought back. The last few months before his conviction. The final pursuit in Chronos. He'd been close, so close to catching Alexei. And then—</p>
<p>"I hesitated," he said quietly.</p>
<p>"When?"</p>
<p>"In Chronos. I had a clear shot. Stun weapon. I could have taken him down. But I..." Dmitri closed his eyes. "I hesitated. Just for a second. And he escaped."</p>
<p>"Why did you hesitate?"</p>
<p>"Because he looked at me." The memory was sharp, painful. "He looked at me, and for just a moment, he wasn't the outlaw. He was my brother. The boy I grew up with. The one who used to make me laugh. And I couldn't pull the trigger."</p>
<p>"That's contamination," Reeves said gently. "That moment of hesitation. That's when personal feelings compromised professional duty."</p>
<p>"I know." Dmitri opened his eyes. "That's why I'm here. To be corrected. To learn how to separate duty from emotion."</p>
<p>Reeves studied him for a long moment. "Do you want to be corrected, Dmitri?"</p>
<p>The question was a trap. Dmitri could feel it. Say yes, and he'd be admitting he was broken. Say no, and he'd be admitting he was resistant.</p>
<p>"I want to understand," Dmitri said carefully. "I want to understand why doing my duty wasn't enough. Why one moment of hesitation erased three years of service. I want to understand what I did wrong so I can do better."</p>
<p>"What if you didn't do anything wrong?"</p>
<p>Dmitri blinked. "Sir?"</p>
<p>"What if," Reeves continued, his voice dropping, "the system made a mistake? What if you were convicted not because you hesitated, but because you were too effective? Too knowledgeable? Too dangerous?"</p>
<p>This was a different trap. A test. Was Reeves trying to see if Dmitri would accept conspiracy theories? Or was he... was he trying to tell Dmitri something?</p>
<p>"The Judge doesn't make mistakes," Dmitri said automatically.</p>
<p>"The Judge is a tool," Reeves replied. "Tools can be misused."</p>
<p>They stared at each other. Dmitri's heart pounded. What was happening here?</p>
<p>"Dr. Reeves, I don't understand what you're asking me."</p>
<p>Reeves leaned back, his expression unreadable. "I'm asking if you've noticed anything unusual about your group. Group Seven. Eight inmates, all convicted the same day, all with specialized knowledge, all placed together."</p>
<p>"I've noticed," Dmitri admitted carefully.</p>
<p>"And what do you think it means?"</p>
<p>"I think..." Dmitri chose his words with precision. "I think someone wanted us here. Together. For a reason."</p>
<p>"What reason?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. Either to silence us... or to see what we'd do."</p>
<p>Reeves smiled slightly. "You're smarter than you pretend to be, Dmitri Volkov. That's good. You'll need that intelligence in the coming days."</p>
<p>"Sir, I don't—"</p>
<p>"Session's over." Reeves stood abruptly. "Return to your cell. Think about what we discussed. We'll talk again soon."</p>
<p>Dmitri stood, confused and unsettled. "Dr. Reeves, are you... are you trying to help us?"</p>
<p>Reeves's expression was carefully neutral. "I'm trying to do my job, Mr. Volkov. Just like you were. Sometimes our jobs require us to make difficult choices. Sometimes they require us to see things we'd rather not see."</p>
<p>He opened the door. "Dismissed."</p>
<p>Dmitri walked out, his mind racing. That wasn't a normal correction session. That was... what? A warning? An invitation? A test?</p>
<p>He needed to tell the others. But carefully. Very carefully.</p>
<p>Because if Dr. Reeves was trying to help them, that was good.</p>
<p>But if he was trying to trap them, that was very, very bad.</p>
<p>And Dmitri, trained enforcer, expert in tactics and security, couldn't tell which it was.</p>
<hr />
<p>That night, Dmitri lay in his cell, staring at the ceiling. The brass clock on his wall ticked forward. Always forward. Never back. Time was a river that flowed in one direction, and they were all being carried downstream toward something.</p>
<p>He thought about duty. About order. About the three years he'd spent hunting his brother.</p>
<p>He thought about that moment in Chronos. Alexei's face. The hesitation. The choice he'd made without realizing he was making it.</p>
<p>He'd chosen family over duty.</p>
<p>And the system had punished him for it.</p>
<p>But maybe—maybe—that was the right choice. Maybe the system was wrong. Maybe duty to humanity mattered more than duty to order.</p>
<p>Maybe love was more important than law.</p>
<p>The thought was terrifying and liberating in equal measure.</p>
<p>Dmitri closed his eyes and, for the first time in three years, let himself remember his brothers not as targets or problems, but as family.</p>
<p>Alexei, brilliant and rebellious, always questioning, always pushing boundaries.</p>
<p>Nikolai, anxious and brilliant, always mediating, always trying to keep them together.</p>
<p>And himself, rigid and dutiful, always following rules, always seeking order.</p>
<p>Three brothers. Three paths. One bond that even the system couldn't break.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, he'd tell the others about Dr. Reeves. Tomorrow, they'd figure out what it meant.</p>
<p>Tonight, he'd just be a brother again.</p>
<p>It felt like coming home.</p>
