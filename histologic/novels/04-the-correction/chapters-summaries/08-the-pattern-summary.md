**Timeline**: August 15, 2106 (Day 15 in facility)  
**Word Count**: ~200 words

## Key Events

Marcus Chen experiences a crisis of faith as he analyzes the evidence the group has gathered. His analyst mind identifies an impossible pattern: all eight were convicted at exactly 14:37:22—but The Judge processes sequentially. This simultaneity is impossible unless the convictions were pre-loaded.

He reviews Nikolai's evidence of live fact manipulation, Reeves's Project Correction documents, and his own observations. The conclusion is undeniable: the system he believed in is fundamentally corrupt. Not flawed—corrupt.

Marcus struggles with this realization. He's spent his life believing in Histologic, in The Judge, in objective truth. Now he must accept that the implementation is broken, even if the ideal remains sound. He decides to stay in Veridica after escape and fight to reform the system from within.

Kira finds him in crisis and they discuss the difference between the ideal and the implementation. She agrees to stay with him, and their partnership deepens. Marcus resolves his doubt: he'll fight for the Histologic ideal by exposing and fixing the corrupt implementation.

## Character Development

Marcus's crisis of faith resolves into pragmatic idealism—he'll fight for the system's ideal while acknowledging its current corruption. His relationship with Kira deepens as she agrees to stay and fight with him.
