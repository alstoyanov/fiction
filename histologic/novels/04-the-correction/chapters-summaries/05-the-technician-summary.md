# Chapter 5 Summary: The Technician

**POV**: Nikolai Volkov  
**Timeline**: August 6, 2106 (Day 6 in facility)  
**Word Count**: ~200 words

## Key Events

Nikolai Volkov, the mediator brother and technical genius, struggles with being imprisoned alongside both his brothers—Dmitri, whom he helped as an enforcer, and Alexei, whom he secretly aided as an outlaw. He's spent three years trying to keep both brothers alive while they hunted each other.

During his correction session, Nikolai's technical knowledge allows him to notice anomalies in the facility's systems. He realizes the correction technology is more sophisticated than publicly known and begins mentally mapping the network infrastructure.

Mikhail finds Nikolai in the library and sings "Should I Stay or Should I Go" by The Clash, perfectly capturing Nikolai's internal conflict about which brother to support. The old man suggests that maybe Nikolai doesn't have to choose—maybe he can help both.

Nikolai discovers a maintenance access point that could provide entry to the facility's core systems. He begins planning how to use his technical skills to aid an escape, realizing that for the first time in three years, he might be able to help both his brothers simultaneously.

## Character Development

Nikolai begins to see a path where he doesn't have to choose between his brothers—where he can be the bridge that reunites them rather than the mediator keeping them apart.
