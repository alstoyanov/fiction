# Chapter 10 Summary: The Triplets Reunite

**POV**: Dmitri Volkov  
**Timeline**: August 17, 2106 (Day 17)  
**Word Count**: ~200 words

## Key Events

The three Volkov brothers meet privately for the first time in three years. It's an emotional reunion—Dmitri apologizes for hunting Alexei, Alexei forgives him, and Nikolai apologizes for helping both while lying to both. They forgive each other and reconnect as family.

They discuss the escape plan: Elena will trigger a fact storm as distraction, and they'll escape together. Alexei explains how Elena has done this before and knows how to control fact storms.

Nikolai reveals devastating news: their uncle, Professor Adrian Volkov, is one of the Architects. He deliberately targeted his own nephews as test subjects for an experiment to see if the system could break family bonds. The brothers are furious but choose justice over revenge—they'll expose him rather than kill him.

They vow to never be separated again and clasp hands: "For family, for truth, for freedom." The experiment failed—family bonds proved stronger than the system.

## Character Development

The triplets' emotional reunion and forgiveness heal three years of conflict. They unite against their uncle's betrayal and commit to staying together forever. Dmitri completes his transformation from hunter to protector.
