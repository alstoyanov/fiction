# Chapter 4 Summary: The Outlaw

**POV**: Alexei Volkov  
**Timeline**: August 5, 2106 (Day 5 in facility)  
**Word Count**: ~200 words

## Key Events

Alexei Volkov, experienced outlaw on his fourth imprisonment, observes the group dynamics during his first correction session. Unlike his brothers, he's comfortable with uncertainty and questions everything. He recognizes Marcus as a true believer and Kira as a questioner, noting the tension between them.

During the session, Alexei subtly challenges the correction process, earning Dr. Reeves's attention. After the session, he begins mapping the facility's security systems and identifying potential escape routes—his specialty.

Mikhail approaches Alexei in the garden, singing "Imagine" by John Lennon. The old man hints that he knows more than he should about Alexei's past escapes and suggests they might be working toward the same goal. Alexei realizes Mikhail might be connected to his Aunt Elena and the resistance network.

Alexei begins planning his fourth escape, but this time with a difference—he's considering taking others with him. The group is forming, and he's starting to see them not as fellow inmates but as potential allies.

## Character Development

Alexei transforms from lone wolf to potential team player, recognizing that this escape might require cooperation rather than solo action.
