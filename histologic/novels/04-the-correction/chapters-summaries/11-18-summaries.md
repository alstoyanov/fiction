## Chapter 15: The Believer's Doubt (Marcus)
**Timeline**: August 21, 2106 (1 day until escape)

Mikhail sings "We Shall Overcome" and "All You Need Is Love," explains love as revolutionary act. Marcus ready: doubt resolved through love, not certainty.

## Chapter 16: The Alliance (Kira)
**Timeline**: August 22, 2106, 0200-0400 (12-10 hours before escape)

All eight meet for final planning. Kira details complete timeline (1350-1410, 20 minutes total). Individual roles assigned. Post-escape paths revealed: Dr. Tanaka→Chronos, Isaiah→SFW, Dmitri & Alexei→Resistance, Nikolai→Underground, Mikhail→his choice, Marcus & Kira→stay in Veridica (most dangerous). 

Kira explains how the fact storm will work: Elena will inject contradictory facts into both factorepos, broadcast towers will transmit both simultaneously, everyone's neural interfaces will receive contradictory signals. The buildings won't actually flicker—it's perceptual breakdown. Brain receives "eyes say brass building" + "interface says abandoned warehouse" + "interface says glass facility" and can't reconcile them. Guards will be equally affected. Everyone in 5km radius will experience it, including civilians—some will be permanently damaged. That's the cost of their freedom.

Mikhail explains fact storm effects and how to survive: hold onto something real like songs. Group sings "You'll Never Walk Alone" together. Marcus and Kira spend final hours together, make pact to keep going if other doesn't make it.
