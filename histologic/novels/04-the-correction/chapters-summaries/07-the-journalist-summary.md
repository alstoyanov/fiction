# Chapter 7 Summary: The Journalist

**POV**: Isaiah Okonkwo  
**Timeline**: August 8, 2106 (Day 8 in facility)  
**Word Count**: ~200 words

## Key Events

Isaiah Okonkwo, investigative journalist with photographic memory, has been documenting everything since his conviction. He was imprisoned for publishing articles questioning official historical narratives. Now he's documenting the correction facility itself, storing every detail in his perfect memory.

During his session, Isaiah realizes he's not just observing—he's part of the story. The eight of them, convicted simultaneously at 14:37:22, represent something larger. He begins to see the pattern: they're not random inmates, they're specialists targeted for elimination.

Isaiah discovers Dr. Reeves's hidden files about "Project Correction Phase 2"—a plan to expand correction beyond criminals to anyone who questions official narratives. This is systematic thought control, not rehabilitation.

Mikhail finds Isaiah in the library and discusses the power of stories versus facts. He explains that while The Judge can verify facts, only stories can transform hearts. Isaiah realizes his role: he must document this story and publish it, exposing the corruption to the world.

## Character Development

Isaiah transforms from passive observer to active participant, understanding that bearing witness is itself an act of resistance—and that his story might change everything.
