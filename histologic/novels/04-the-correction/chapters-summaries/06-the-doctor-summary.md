# Chapter 6 Summary: The Doctor

**POV**: Dr. Yuki Tanaka  
**Timeline**: August 7, 2106 (Day 7 in facility)  
**Word Count**: ~200 words

## Key Events

Dr. Yuki Tanaka, neural specialist convicted for refusing to perform a correction procedure, maintains her medical ethics despite imprisonment. She refused to correct Patient 7743 (Sarah), a young woman whose only "crime" was asking questions, because the patient didn't need correction—she needed answers.

During a private meeting with Director Kovač, Yuki is offered early release if she'll perform the correction. She refuses again, citing her oath: "First, do no harm." This refusal plants seeds of doubt in Kovač, who begins questioning whether the correction system is truly therapeutic.

Mikhail visits Yuki in the medical wing and sings "Lean on Me" by Bill Withers, recognizing her as the group's moral anchor. He tells her that sometimes the greatest healing comes from refusing to break people, even when ordered to.

Yuki realizes that her refusal to correct Sarah—and her continued refusal to compromise her ethics—might be inspiring others to question the system. She begins to see her role not just as a healer of bodies, but as a protector of humanity itself.

## Character Development

Dr. Tanaka solidifies her role as the group's ethical conscience, proving that some principles are worth imprisonment—and that integrity can inspire others to question unjust systems.
