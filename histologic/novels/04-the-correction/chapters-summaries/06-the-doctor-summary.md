# Chapter 6 Summary: The Doctor

**POV**: Dr. Yuki Tanaka  
**Timeline**: August 7, 2106 (Day 7 in facility)  
**Word Count**: ~200 words

## Key Events

Dr. Yuki Tanaka, neural specialist convicted for refusing to perform a correction procedure, maintains her medical ethics despite imprisonment. She refused to correct Patient 7743 (Sarah), a young woman whose only "crime" was asking questions, because the patient didn't need correction—she needed answers.

During a private meeting with Director Kovač, Yuki confronts her about the corruption in the system. She convinces Kovač to consider helping Group Seven escape, appealing to her better nature. Kovač is troubled but agrees to think about it.

After dinner, Marcus asks Yuki about his worsening headaches. She explains the neural interface system: the bio-integrated mesh in everyone's hippocampus and prefrontal cortex receives factorepo broadcasts and integrates them into memory formation. Marcus's interface works perfectly, but he can still question what it tells him—that's why he's here. 

Marcus asks if interfaces can be removed. Yuki explains: full removal is fatal, but she can disable receivers and remove tracking components (5-10% mortality, 20% complications). She's helped 53 people; 48 survived. She remembers every one. Refuseniks (<0.1% of population) live in grey zones with no rights, hunted if visible. Non-Histologic nations exist: SFW refuses interfaces, CNT uses different control. "Architects don't want us to know alternatives exist."

Enhanced correction will use the interface to override their organic memories and reshape their personalities.

Mikhail sings "Lean on Me" in the dining hall, reinforcing their solidarity. Yuki realizes that her refusal to compromise her ethics might be inspiring others to question the system.

## Character Development

Dr. Tanaka solidifies her role as the group's ethical conscience, proving that some principles are worth imprisonment—and that integrity can inspire others to question unjust systems.
