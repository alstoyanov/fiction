# Chapter 5: The Technician

## POV: Nikolai Volkov

Nikolai had always been the middle child. Not in birth order—they were triplets, born minutes apart—but in temperament. Dmitri was the rigid one, all rules and duty. Alexei was the rebel, all questions and defiance. Nikolai was the one who tried to hold them together, the mediator, the bridge.

It was exhausting.

Now, sitting in the facility's maintenance room at 0300, surrounded by humming servers and blinking lights, Nikolai felt that exhaustion in his bones. He'd been awake for twenty hours, using his assigned "library time" to instead slip into restricted areas, accessing systems he wasn't supposed to touch.

But he was good at his job. Very good. And the facility's security, while sophisticated, wasn't designed to stop someone who understood it from the inside.

The screen in front of him showed live factorepo feeds. Not the public interface—the backend, the actual database where facts were stored, processed, and verified. Nikolai had spent days finding a way in, using his knowledge of system architecture and a few tricks he'd learned from less-than-legal sources.

What he was seeing made his hands shake.

Facts were being altered. In real-time. As he watched.

A fact about a border incident between Veridica and Chronos: timestamp changed, location shifted, participants modified. Small changes. Subtle. The kind you wouldn't notice unless you were watching the raw data.

Another fact, about a government official's meeting: attendees list altered, one name removed, another added. Again, subtle. Again, deliberate.

Nikolai pulled up the audit logs, trying to trace who was making these changes. The system showed automated processes, routine maintenance, standard operations.

But Nikolai knew systems. He knew how they worked, how they logged, how they tracked. And these changes weren't automated. They were manual. Someone with high-level access was modifying facts directly, then covering their tracks by making it look like system processes.

He dug deeper, following the digital trail. The changes originated from a government building in central Veridica. Specific terminal. Specific user credentials.

Minister's office.

Nikolai's breath caught. Not just any corruption. Not just some low-level official tweaking records. This was coming from the top. From people who made policy, who shaped Veridica's direction, who controlled The Judge's inputs.

He started recording everything. Screenshots, logs, data streams. Evidence. Undeniable, technical, precise evidence.

A sound behind him.

Nikolai spun, heart hammering.

Mikhail stood in the doorway, white hair glowing in the server lights, expression serene.

"You should be in your cell," Nikolai whispered.

"So should you." Mikhail moved into the room with surprising grace for his age. "But here we both are, seeking truth in the darkness."

"How did you—"

"I'm old, not blind." Mikhail settled into a chair. "I've been watching you, young Nikolai. Watching you slip away during library time, watching you return with troubled eyes. You've found something, haven't you?"

Nikolai hesitated. Trust was dangerous. But Mikhail was part of their group, part of the eight. And something about the old man's calm presence made Nikolai want to share the burden.

"I've found proof," Nikolai said quietly. "Live fact manipulation. Coming from the Minister's office. They're changing history in real-time."

Mikhail nodded slowly, as if this confirmed something he'd suspected. "The old songs knew. 'He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.'"

"That's Orwell. '1984.'"

"A prophet, that one. Saw what was coming." Mikhail leaned forward. "What will you do with this proof?"

"Give it to the others. Show them. We need evidence if we're going to expose this."

"And then?"

"And then..." Nikolai trailed off. He hadn't thought that far ahead. "And then we escape. We get this evidence out. We publish it. We—"

"We start a war," Mikhail finished gently. "That's what this evidence will do, Nikolai. It will shatter faith in the system. It will make people question everything. It will tear Veridica apart."

"Good," Nikolai said, surprising himself with his vehemence. "It should be torn apart. It's built on lies."

"Perhaps." Mikhail's eyes were distant. "But when you tear something apart, you must be prepared to build something better. Otherwise, you just create chaos."

"Better chaos than this."

"Is it?" Mikhail started humming, then singing softly:

*"Imagine there's no countries, it isn't hard to do,*
*Nothing to kill or die for, and no religion too...*
*Imagine all the people, living life in peace..."*

He stopped, smiled sadly. "John Lennon. He imagined a better world. They shot him for it. The old times knew: truth-tellers are dangerous. They're also necessary."

"I don't understand what you're trying to tell me."

"I'm telling you to be careful. To think about consequences. To remember that evidence is a weapon, and weapons can hurt the wielder as much as the target." Mikhail stood. "But I'm also telling you to continue. Because some truths must be told, regardless of cost."

"You're very confusing, you know that?"

Mikhail laughed quietly. "The old songs were confusing too. That's why they lasted. Simple answers don't survive complexity. Only questions do."

He moved to the door, paused. "There's a riddle about this. What breaks when you speak it? What shatters when you share it? What destroys when you reveal it?"

"I don't know."

"A secret." Mikhail's expression was serious now. "The secret you've found will break things, Nikolai. Make sure you're ready for what comes after."

He left, silent as a ghost.

Nikolai sat alone with the humming servers and the damning evidence on his screen. Mikhail was right. This would break things. Shatter faith. Destroy certainty.

But maybe that's what needed to happen.

Maybe broken things could be rebuilt better.

He continued recording, continued documenting. Hours passed. The evidence grew. And with each new fact manipulation he captured, Nikolai felt his own certainty solidify.

The system was corrupt. Not flawed. Not imperfect. Deliberately, systematically corrupt.

And they were going to expose it.

Three days later, the library meeting reconvened.

All eight inmates gathered in the darkness, moving like shadows, speaking in whispers. Nikolai had the evidence ready—printed screenshots, data logs, everything he'd captured.

"I found it," he said without preamble. "Live fact manipulation. Coming from the Minister's office. I have proof."

He spread the documents on the table. Even in the dim light, the evidence was clear.

Marcus stared at the papers, his face pale. "This is... this is Judge-level corruption. This is someone with direct access to the factorepo inputs."

"Not just someone," Kira said, scanning the data with her technical eye. "Multiple someones. Look at the access patterns. Different terminals, different times, coordinated changes. This is organized."

"A conspiracy," Isaiah said, and his voice carried the weight of documentation. "A systematic effort to control history."

"But why?" Dr. Tanaka asked. "What's the purpose?"

"Control," Dmitri said, his enforcer's mind seeing the tactical picture. "If you control the facts, you control what people believe. If you control what people believe, you control what they do."

"And if anyone questions it," Alexei added, "you convict them of contamination and lock them up. Like us."

Nikolai pulled out one more document. "There's something else. I found our names in the system. There's a file labeled 'Project Correction.' It lists all eight of us. With a note: 'High-priority containment. Monitor for resistance formation.'"

"They knew," Kira said. "They knew we'd figure it out. They knew we'd work together. They're watching us right now."

"Not right now," Nikolai said. "I've been disabling surveillance during our meetings. But yes, they're watching. They've been watching since we arrived."

"Then why haven't they stopped us?" Marcus asked.

Everyone looked at each other.

"Because," Mikhail said from the shadows, "they want to see what we'll do. We're an experiment. A test. They put eight specialists together to see if we'd discover the truth. And if we'd try to escape."

"Why would they want that?" Dr. Tanaka asked.

"Maybe to see if their security holds," Dmitri suggested. "Test the system."

"Or maybe," Alexei said slowly, "to see if we'd lead them to the resistance. To Elena. To everyone who's helping us."

Silence fell.

"That's why Dr. Reeves gave me the data chip," Alexei continued. "That's why he's 'helping' us. He's bait. We're bait. They want us to escape so they can follow us to the resistance and take everyone down at once."

"Or," Nikolai said, "Dr. Reeves is genuine, and we're overthinking this."

"Can we risk it?" Kira asked.

Marcus stood, paced. "We have two choices. Stay here and be corrected—or worse. Or escape and risk leading them to the resistance."

"There's a third choice," Isaiah said. "We escape, but we don't go to the resistance. We go public. Immediately. We publish everything before they can stop us."

"How?" Dmitri asked. "The moment we escape, they'll lock down communications, freeze our access, hunt us down."

"Not if we're fast enough," Isaiah said. "Not if we have a plan."

"I have contacts in SFW," Isaiah continued. "Independent journalists. If we can get this evidence across the border, they'll publish it. Veridica can't stop foreign press."

"Getting across the border is the hard part," Dmitri said.

"Not if Elena helps," Alexei said. "She has extraction routes. Safe houses. She can get us out."

"And lead them right to her," Kira pointed out.

They were going in circles. Nikolai felt the frustration building. They had evidence. They had skills. They had motivation. But they didn't have a clear path forward.

"There's a song about this," Mikhail said suddenly. He sang:

*"Should I stay or should I go now?*
*If I go, there will be trouble,*
*And if I stay it will be double..."*

Despite everything, several people smiled.

"The old punk rockers knew," Mikhail said. "Sometimes there's no good choice. Only less bad ones. So you choose, and you live with it."

"Then we choose," Marcus said firmly. "We escape. We publish. We accept the risks. Because staying here means they win. And I'm not ready to let them win."

He looked around the circle. "Are you?"

One by one, they nodded.

"Then we plan," Kira said. "Properly. Carefully. We use every skill we have. And we make sure that when we move, we move fast enough that they can't stop us."

"How long do we have?" Dr. Tanaka asked.

"Not long," Nikolai said. "The individual sessions are escalating. They're going to start enhanced correction soon. Neural manipulation. Once that starts, we won't be able to resist. We'll forget what we know, forget why we're fighting."

"How long?" Alexei pressed.

"A week. Maybe two."

"Then we have two weeks to plan a perfect escape," Dmitri said.

"There's no such thing as a perfect escape," Alexei said. "But there are successful ones. And I've done three of them."

"Fourth time's the charm?" Kira asked.

"Let's hope so." Alexei grinned. "Because this time, I'm not leaving anyone behind."

They began to plan in earnest. Nikolai provided technical details. Dmitri outlined security protocols. Alexei described extraction routes. Kira identified system vulnerabilities. Isaiah planned the publication strategy. Dr. Tanaka prepared medical supplies. Marcus coordinated it all, his analyst's mind seeing the big picture.

And Mikhail sat in the corner, humming old songs, occasionally offering wisdom in the form of riddles and lyrics.

By the time they dispersed, they had the skeleton of a plan.

It was dangerous. It was risky. It required perfect timing and a lot of luck.

But it was possible.

And possible was all they needed.
