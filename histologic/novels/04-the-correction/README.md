### Wise Speakers Integration

**Dr. Yuki Tanaka** - Medical/healing wisdom:
- "A wound must be acknowledged before it can heal"
- Uses medical metaphors
- Gentle, compassionate insights

**Isaiah Okonkwo** - Historical/journalistic insights:
- "History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes"
- Provides historical context
- Documents everything

**Mikhail "Old Songs" Petrov** - Pre-Histologic wisdom:
- Constantly sings songs from old times
- Gives riddles and quotes
- "The old songs knew truths we've forgotten"
- Songs address problems Histologic can't solve: love, grief, meaning, beauty

### Key Songs for Mikhail

**On Love**: "All You Need Is Love" (Beatles)
**On Freedom**: "I Will Survive" (Gloria Gaynor)
**On War**: "Where Have All the Flowers Gone" (Pete Seeger)
**On Change**: "The Times They Are A-Changin'" (Bob Dylan)
**On Truth**: "Blowin' in the Wind" (Bob Dylan)
**On Resistance**: "We Shall Overcome" (Civil Rights anthem)
**On Death**: "Amazing Grace" (Traditional spiritual)

Use songs contextually—Mikhail sings when words aren't enough.
