**Date**: April 2, 2110  
**Location**: National Memorial Cemetery  
**POV**: Dmitri Volkov  
**Word Count Target**: ~3,500 words

## Summary

Dmitri Volkov stands before thousands of graves. The National Memorial Cemetery, created for war dead. Twenty-five thousand soldiers. Fifteen thousand civilians. Forty thousand graves. Forty thousand names. Forty thousand lives ended.

One of those names is Alexei Volkov.

Today is the national funeral ceremony. Honoring the fallen. Remembering the dead. Making their sacrifice meaningful—if that's possible.

Thousands attend. Soldiers, civilians, families, survivors. Chancellor Petrov will speak. General Sokolov will speak. Marcus Chen will speak. And Dmitri—he's been asked to speak for Alexei. For his brother. For the fallen.

He stands at Alexei's grave. Simple marker. Name, dates, rank. "Alexei Volkov. Resistance Fighter. Died Free."

Died free. That's what matters, supposedly. But Dmitri would rather have his brother alive and enslaved than dead and free. Wouldn't he?

He doesn't know anymore.

The ceremony begins. Petrov speaks about sacrifice, honor, freedom. Sokolov speaks about duty, courage, victory. Marcus speaks about The Judge, about choice, about meaning.

Then it's Dmitri's turn. He walks to the podium. Looks at the thousands of graves. The thousands of faces watching him. What can he say that matters? What words are adequate?

He speaks:

"My brother Alexei believed in fighting for what's right, even when the cost is everything. He paid that cost. So did thousands of others here. Were they right? I don't know. But they believed. And they died believing. That has to mean something."

"We won this war. But we paid too much. Every grave here is too much. Every name is too much. And yet... they chose. They fought. They died free. That's not nothing."

"I don't know if it was worth it. I'll never know. No one can answer that except the dead. And they can't answer."

"But I know this: Alexei would say it was worth it. He chose to fight. He chose to sacrifice. He chose to die protecting others. That was his choice. His freedom. His life, completed on his terms."

"I'll honor that. By living. By building. By making sure their deaths weren't for nothing. By being worthy of their sacrifice."

"We can't bring them back. We can't undo their deaths. But we can honor them. By living well. By building well. By staying free. By remembering."

"Alexei, brother, I miss you. I'll always miss you. But I'll honor you. By living the life you died to protect. By being free. By choosing. By being human."

"To all the fallen: we remember you. We honor you. We will make your sacrifice meaningful. Rest well. You earned it."

He steps down. Returns to Nikolai and Elena. The three Volkov siblings, now. United in grief, in survival, in determination.

After the ceremony, they visit Alexei's grave together. Place flowers. Stand in silence.

Elena speaks first: "He would have hated the ceremony. Too formal. Too public."

Dmitri: "He would have loved that we're here. Together."

Nikolai: "He died so we could be free. Now we have to figure out what to do with that freedom."

They think about this. Freedom. That's what Alexei died for. What The Judge died for. What thousands died for.

But what is freedom? The right to choose? The absence of control? The ability to make mistakes?

All of that. And more. Freedom is uncertainty. Risk. The possibility of being wrong. The responsibility of being human.

It's terrifying. But it's theirs.

Elena: "I'm going to continue resistance work. Not against SFW—they're gone. But against whatever threatens freedom. That's my purpose now."

Nikolai: "I'm going to help build the new systems. Advisory AI, not controlling. Partnership, not slavery. That's how I honor The Judge."

Dmitri: "I'm going to help rebuild the military. Defensive, not aggressive. Protecting, not conquering. That's how I honor Alexei."

Three siblings. Three purposes. One goal: honor the dead by living well.

They leave the cemetery together. Behind them, forty thousand graves. Forty thousand sacrifices. Forty thousand reasons to build something better.

That evening, Dmitri sits alone, looking at the photo—four Volkov siblings, before the war. He's looked at it hundreds of times. Each time, it hurts.

But it also reminds him. They were happy once. They were together. They were whole.

They can't be whole again. Alexei is gone. But they can be happy. They can be together. They can honor him by living.

He thinks about sacrifice. Is it ever worth it? Can death ever be meaningful?

He doesn't have answers. But he has Alexei's choice. Alexei thought it was worth it. He chose to sacrifice. He chose to die protecting others.

Dmitri will honor that choice. By living. By building. By staying free. By being worthy.

That's all he can do. That's enough.

The chapter ends with Dmitri placing the photo on his desk. Four siblings. Now three. But still family. Still united. Still fighting—not with weapons anymore, but with purpose.

For Alexei. For the fallen. For freedom.

He thinks of a song: "Tears in Heaven" by Eric Clapton. "Would you know my name / If I saw you in heaven?"

He hopes Alexei knows his name. Knows he's remembered. Knows he's honored. Knows his death mattered.

He hopes. That's all he can do.

Hope. Remember. Honor. Live.

That's enough.
