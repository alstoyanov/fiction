# Chapter 29: The Counterattack

**Date**: March 19-25, 2110  
**Location**: Veridica Territory, Multiple Fronts  
**POV**: General Yevgenia Sokolov  
**Word Count Target**: ~3,500 words

## Summary

General Sokolov stands in the command center, watching SFW forces retreat. They're disorganized, demoralized, collapsing. The Judge's destruction broke them. Now it's time to finish them.

"All units," she orders, "commence counteroffensive. Drive them back across the border. End this war."

The counterattack launches across multiple fronts. Veridica forces—exhausted but determined—pursue the retreating SFW. What was a siege becomes a rout.

**Northern Front**: Dmitri leads the charge. His troops fight with fury and grief. For Alexei. For the fallen. For everyone lost. They push SFW back kilometer by kilometer, liberating occupied cities, reclaiming territory.

**Eastern Front**: Regular forces coordinate with The Judge's final intelligence data—preserved before destruction. They know SFW positions, supply routes, retreat paths. They hit them where they're weakest.

**Behind Enemy Lines**: Elena's resistance emerges from shadows. Sabotage. Ambushes. Cutting supply lines. SFW forces caught between defenders and resistance. Nowhere to run.

**Southern Front**: Fresh reserves—held back during the siege—now deploy. They're not exhausted like SFW. They're ready. They overwhelm the retreating forces.

Sokolov coordinates it all. Not just military victory—strategic victory. She wants SFW expelled completely. She wants them to never return. She wants this war ended permanently.

Within days, SFW forces are pushed back fifty kilometers. Then a hundred. Then two hundred. Occupied cities are liberated. Civilians freed. Territory reclaimed.

But the cost is visible everywhere. Destroyed buildings. Cratered streets. Mass graves. The war's scars will take years to heal. Maybe decades. Maybe never.

Sokolov visits liberated cities. Sees the destruction. Meets with survivors—traumatized, grieving, grateful. They thank her for liberating them. She doesn't feel like a liberator. She feels like someone who let them be conquered in the first place.

By March 25, SFW forces are expelled from Veridica. The last enemy soldier crosses the border. The war is over. Militarily, Veridica won.

But Sokolov calculates the cost:
- 25,000 Veridica soldiers dead
- 50,000 wounded
- 15,000 civilians dead
- Three cities destroyed
- Economy devastated
- The Judge gone
- Society transformed

Is this victory? She doesn't know. They survived. They're free. But at what cost?

She meets with her command staff. They're celebrating—exhausted, traumatized, but celebrating. They won. Against overwhelming odds, they won.

But Sokolov doesn't celebrate. She thinks about the ancient concept of Pyrrhic victory—winning at unsustainable cost. That's what this is. They won the war. But they lost so much that victory feels hollow.

She thinks of a song: "We Are the Champions" by Queen. It plays ironically in her mind. They are champions. But it doesn't feel triumphant. It feels exhausting.

That evening, Chancellor Petrov calls: "General, you've done remarkable work. Veridica owes you everything."

"We did what was necessary, Chancellor. Nothing more."

"You won an unwinnable war."

"We survived an invasion. That's not the same as winning."

"It's close enough. The people need victory. Give them that."

"The people need truth. We won militarily. But we lost The Judge. We lost thousands of lives. We lost our foundation. That's not victory. That's survival."

"Sometimes survival is victory."

"Maybe. But it doesn't feel like it."

Sokolov ends the call. Returns to coordinating post-war operations. Securing borders. Treating wounded. Burying dead. Rebuilding cities.

The war is over. But the work is just beginning.

She thinks about her career. She became a general to prevent war. She failed at that. Then she commanded a desperate defense. She succeeded at that. But success feels like failure.

Maybe that's what war is. No winners. Just survivors. Just people trying to make meaning from meaningless violence.

The chapter ends with Sokolov issuing final military orders. Stand down offensive operations. Secure borders. Begin demobilization. Transition to peacetime.

The war is over. They won. But it doesn't feel like winning. It feels like ending. Like surviving. Like beginning again from ruins.

And maybe that's enough. Maybe survival is victory. Maybe living to rebuild is triumph.

She hopes so. Because that's all they have.
