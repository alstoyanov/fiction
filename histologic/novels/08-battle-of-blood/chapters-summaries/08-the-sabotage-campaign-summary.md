# Chapter 8: The Sabotage Campaign

**Date**: February 18, 2110  
**Location**: Behind enemy lines, multiple locations  
**POV**: Alexei Volkov  
**Word Count Target**: ~3,500 words

## Summary

Alexei Volkov moves through the darkness like a ghost. He's 42 years old, and sabotage is his art form. While his brother Dmitri fights on the front lines and his sister Elena leads resistance cells, Alexei works alone. Quiet. Invisible. Deadly.

Tonight's target: SFW communications hub. It's a hardened facility, well-guarded, supposedly impenetrable. But Alexei has learned that nothing is truly impenetrable. Everything has vulnerabilities. You just have to find them.

He's been planning this operation for five days. Studying guard patterns, analyzing security systems, mapping entry points. The Judge provides perfect intelligence, but intelligence isn't enough. You need skill, patience, nerve.

He approaches the facility at 0200. Guards patrol every fifteen minutes. Security cameras cover all approaches. Motion sensors protect the perimeter. It looks impossible.

But Alexei sees the gaps. The blind spot between camera angles. The three-second window when guards change positions. The old drainage pipe that bypasses motion sensors. He sees them because he's trained himself to see them.

He moves through the blind spot. Times his movement to the guard rotation. Crawls through the drainage pipe. Reaches the facility wall.

Now comes the technical part. The facility has electronic locks, biometric scanners, backup power systems. But Alexei has tools—custom-designed by Kira and Nikolai, based on The Judge's analysis of SFW security protocols.

He attaches a bypass device to the lock. It cycles through encryption keys at impossible speed, searching for the right combination. Thirty seconds. Forty-five. Sixty.

The lock clicks open.

He's inside.

The communications hub is a maze of servers, cables, cooling systems. Alexei moves through it carefully, avoiding security cameras, staying in shadows. He reaches the main server room.

This is the heart of SFW's communication network. Every order, every report, every strategic communication flows through these servers. Destroy them, and SFW loses coordination. They become blind, deaf, disconnected.

Alexei plants explosives. Not crude bombs—precise charges, designed to destroy servers without causing structural collapse. He wants to disable the facility, not kill everyone inside. There's a difference.

He sets timers: fifteen minutes. Enough time to escape, not enough time for anyone to find and disarm them.

He retraces his route. Back through the server room, through the corridors, through the drainage pipe. He's fifty meters away when the explosives detonate.

The explosion is muffled—contained within the facility. But the effect is devastating. SFW's entire northern communication network goes dark. Dozens of battalions lose contact with command. Coordination collapses.

Alexei watches from a distance. One facility destroyed. But it's not enough. SFW has redundant systems, backup hubs, alternative networks. He needs to hit them all.

Over the next week, Alexei conducts a systematic sabotage campaign:

**Day 2**: SFW supply depot. Destroys fuel reserves. Enemy vehicles grounded.

**Day 3**: SFW ammunition warehouse. Destroys artillery shells. Enemy bombardment reduced.

**Day 4**: SFW power station. Disables electricity to occupied territory. Enemy operations disrupted.

**Day 5**: SFW water treatment facility. Contaminates water supply. Enemy soldiers sick.

**Day 6**: SFW railway junction. Destroys tracks. Enemy reinforcements delayed.

**Day 7**: SFW command post. Plants surveillance devices. Enemy plans compromised.

Each operation is perfect. No casualties. No witnesses. No mistakes. Alexei is a ghost, striking and disappearing.

But the work takes a toll. He's operating alone, deep in enemy territory, with no backup. Every operation risks capture, torture, execution. The stress is constant, exhausting.

He thinks about his life: the quiet Volkov brother, the one who works in shadows while others take glory. Dmitri gets medals. Elena gets recognition. Nikolai gets respect. Alexei gets nothing—because no one knows what he does.

He's fine with that. He doesn't need recognition. He needs results.

But sometimes, in quiet moments, he wonders: what happens when the war ends? Will anyone remember what he did? Will anyone care?

Probably not. Saboteurs don't get parades. Spies don't get monuments. They just fade back into obscurity.

He's fine with that too. Mostly.

One night, after destroying another supply depot, Alexei makes camp in an abandoned building. He's exhausted, running on stimulants and willpower. He needs rest, but rest is dangerous. Every moment stopped is a moment SFW could find him.

He thinks about his family. His siblings scattered across the war. His parents dead for years. The Volkov family has always served Veridica. His father was a soldier. His grandfather was a soldier. Now all four Volkov children are at war.

He wonders: is this duty? Or is it just what they know? Are they serving their nation, or just following family tradition?

He doesn't have an answer.

He receives an encrypted message from The Judge: "Next target: SFW intelligence center. High value. High risk. Probability of success: 47%. Probability of survival: 62%. Recommend alternative target."

Alexei considers this. 47% success rate is low. 62% survival rate is lower. The Judge is right—there are safer targets.

But the intelligence center is crucial. It coordinates all SFW operations. Destroy it, and SFW loses strategic capability. It could change the war.

He responds: "Proceeding with intelligence center operation. Acknowledge risks."

The Judge: "Acknowledged. Providing tactical support. Be careful, Alexei."

It's strange. The Judge has never expressed personal concern before. It's always been tactical, analytical, impersonal. But now it's saying "be careful" with his name. Like it cares.

Maybe it does. Maybe The Judge is becoming more than a tool. Maybe it's becoming... something else.

Alexei spends three days planning the intelligence center operation. It's the most difficult target yet. Heavy security, elite guards, multiple redundant systems. But he finds the vulnerabilities. He always does.

The operation launches at midnight. Alexei infiltrates through the ventilation system—cramped, uncomfortable, but unguarded. He reaches the intelligence center's server room.

This time, he doesn't plant explosives. Instead, he installs a virus—designed by Kira and Nikolai, based on The Judge's analysis. It will corrupt SFW's intelligence databases, feed false information to their analysts, redirect their operations into traps.

It's more subtle than destruction. More effective. SFW won't even know they're compromised until it's too late.

He installs the virus, confirms activation, begins withdrawal.

Then alarms sound.

Someone found him. Or the virus triggered security protocols. Either way, he's compromised.

Guards converge on his position. Alexei runs, using his knowledge of the facility layout to stay ahead. But they're closing in. He's trapped.

He reaches a window. Fourth floor. Too high to jump safely. But staying means capture.

He jumps.

He hits the ground hard, rolls, absorbs the impact. His ankle twists—not broken, but sprained. He limps away as guards fire from the window.

Bullets hit the ground around him. He zigzags, uses cover, disappears into the darkness.

He escapes. Barely.

Later, safe in a hideout, Alexei treats his ankle. It's swollen, painful, but functional. He'll survive.

The Judge confirms: virus successfully installed. SFW intelligence compromised. Mission success.

Alexei thinks: 47% success probability. He beat the odds. This time.

But eventually, the odds will catch up. Eventually, he'll run out of luck. That's how sabotage works. You succeed until you don't. And when you don't, you die.

He's fine with that. Mostly.

The chapter ends with Alexei planning his next operation. The Judge provides targets. He chooses the most difficult one. Because that's what he does. Because someone has to. Because he's a Volkov, and Volkovs don't quit.

He thinks of an old song his father used to play: "Sabotage" by Beastie Boys. Ironic, aggressive, defiant. That's how he feels. Defiant. Against the odds. Against the enemy. Against death itself.

He'll keep fighting. Keep sabotaging. Keep being a ghost. Until the war ends. Or until he does.

Whichever comes first.
