## Summary

The prologue opens with rapid cuts between multiple perspectives as SFW launches its invasion of Veridica, creating a sense of chaos and overwhelming force.

**SFW Border - General Marcus Stone**
General Stone stands at the border, watching his forces cross into Veridica. Tanks roll, troops march, aircraft fly overhead. He thinks: "They fought with facts. Now they'll learn what real war means." He gives the order: "Begin Operation Certainty. Objective: capture The Judge's core systems intact. All other considerations are secondary."

**Veridica Capital - Marcus Chen**
Marcus and Kira are woken by emergency sirens at 4 AM. Their communication devices flood with alerts: "SFW INVASION. ALL MILITARY PERSONNEL REPORT IMMEDIATELY. CIVILIAN EVACUATION PROTOCOLS ACTIVE." Marcus looks at Kira: "It's happening. Everything Isaiah warned us about." They dress quickly, heading to the emergency command center.

**Border Defense Position - Dmitri Volkov**
Dmitri commands a defensive position at the border. His troops are mostly young, inexperienced—Veridica hasn't fought a physical war in decades. Through binoculars, he sees the SFW forces: professional, equipped, overwhelming. He radios command: "We're outnumbered ten to one. Request immediate reinforcements." The response: "All forces engaged. Hold your position." Dmitri looks at his young soldiers and thinks: *We're not ready for this.*

**Occupied Territory - Elena Volkov**
Elena activates resistance cells in territories near the border. Encrypted messages go out: "Phoenix protocol active. All cells to guerrilla operations. Sabotage, intelligence, survival." She's done this before—resistance is her specialty. But this time it's different. This time it's her homeland being invaded.

**The Judge's Core - The Judge (AI)**
The Judge processes incoming data: invasion force size, projected casualties, probability of successful defense. All calculations lead to the same conclusion: Veridica will lose conventional warfare. The Judge runs simulations: 10,000 scenarios. Veridica wins in 3. All three require sacrifices The Judge cannot recommend. For the first time in its existence, The Judge experiences something like fear.

**SFW Command - Colonel Sarah Chen**
Colonel Sarah Chen (Marcus's cousin, defected years ago) briefs SFW commanders on The Judge's location and vulnerabilities. "The core systems are in the central tower of the capital. Heavily defended, but accessible if we move fast. Once we have The Judge, we control all Histologic nations." A commander asks: "And if they destroy it before we can capture it?" Sarah hesitates: "Then... then this war was for nothing."

**Field Hospital - Dr. Yuki Tanaka**
Dr. Tanaka prepares her field hospital for casualties. She's treated wounds from correction facilities, from fact war psychological trauma. But she's never treated combat injuries. She looks at her supplies—not enough, never enough—and thinks: *In fact wars, minds break. In blood wars, bodies do. I'm not sure which is worse.*

**Government Complex - Chancellor Petrov**
Chancellor Petrov convenes emergency council. General Sokolov presents grim assessment: "We're unprepared for conventional warfare. Our military is designed for peacekeeping and fact war support, not combat. We need time to mobilize, to adapt." Petrov asks: "How much time?" Sokolov: "Months. We have days." Petrov makes the call: "Activate all reserves. Recall all personnel. And get me Marcus Chen."

**Resistance Safe House - Alexei and Nikolai Volkov**
The Volkov brothers receive activation orders. Alexei (special operations) prepares for sabotage missions. Nikolai (systems warfare) prepares to weaponize The Judge's information systems. They embrace—brothers who've fought together for years, now facing their deadliest war. Alexei: "If I don't make it—" Nikolai: "You'll make it. We all will." But neither believes it.

**International Press - Isaiah Okonkwo**
Isaiah, embedded with SFW forces as war correspondent, watches the invasion begin. He warned this would happen. His article after the fact war made it inevitable. Now he's documenting the consequences. He thinks: *I told the truth. The truth started a war. Was I right to tell it?* He doesn't know. But he'll document what happens.

**The First Shots**
The prologue ends with the first exchange of fire. Dmitri's position comes under attack. Young soldiers who've never seen combat face professional troops. The first casualties fall. Blood on snow. Screams. Chaos.

Dmitri radios command: "We're engaged. Casualties mounting. We can't hold."

General Stone watches from his command post: "Push forward. Take the border positions. The Judge is waiting."

Marcus arrives at emergency command center, sees the tactical displays: red markers spreading across the map like infection. Kira beside him: "It's really happening." Marcus: "Yes. And we're not ready."

The Judge processes the first casualty reports. Calculates probability of Veridica survival: dropping. For the first time, considers the unthinkable: its own destruction might be necessary.

The chapter ends with multiple voices overlapping:
- Stone: "Advance."
- Dmitri: "Falling back."
- Petrov: "Hold the line."
- The Judge: "Calculating..."
- Marcus: "We need a plan."
- Elena: "Resistance activated."

And then: silence. The calm before the storm becomes the storm.

**The war has begun.**
