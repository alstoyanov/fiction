# Chapter 14: The Siege Begins

**Date**: March 10, 2110  
**Location**: Veridica Capital, Outer Defensive Ring  
**POV**: Dmitri Volkov  
**Word Count Target**: ~3,500 words

## Summary

Dmitri Volkov stands on the outer defensive ring, watching SFW forces assemble in the distance. Thousands of soldiers. Dozens of tanks. Artillery batteries. Air support. They've fought through three hundred kilometers of Veridica territory to reach this point. Now they're here. At the capital. At the final battle.

The siege begins at dawn. SFW artillery opens up—massive bombardment, shells raining down on defensive positions. Dmitri's troops take cover in reinforced bunkers, waiting for the barrage to end. The ground shakes. Buildings collapse. The sky fills with smoke and fire.

This is different from the guerrilla warfare they've been fighting. This is conventional siege warfare. Brutal. Direct. Overwhelming.

The artillery barrage lasts two hours. Then SFW infantry advances. Thousands of soldiers moving toward the defensive ring. Dmitri gives the order: "All units, fire at will."

The defensive ring erupts. Machine guns, rifles, anti-tank weapons—everything opens up simultaneously. SFW soldiers fall by dozens, then hundreds. But they keep coming. Wave after wave. Relentless.

Dmitri coordinates the defense, moving between positions, rallying troops, directing fire. The Judge provides real-time intelligence: "SFW flanking maneuver, Grid 23. Recommend repositioning forces." Dmitri repositions. The flanking attack fails.

But SFW adapts. They probe for weaknesses, concentrate forces where defenses are thinnest, use combined arms tactics. They're professional, experienced, well-coordinated.

Dmitri's forces are good. But they're outnumbered three to one. And they're exhausted. They've been fighting for six weeks without rest. Some soldiers are falling asleep at their posts. Others are breaking down from stress.

Dmitri moves through the defensive positions, checking on his troops. He finds Corporal Anya—the young woman from Chapter 2, who survived the first battle, who's been with him through the entire war.

She's manning a machine gun position, firing at advancing SFW forces. Dmitri stops to check on her.

"Corporal, how are you holding?"

"Still alive, sir. That's something."

"You're doing good work. Keep it up."

"Sir, can I ask you something?"

"Of course."

"Do you think we'll win? Really win?"

Dmitri considers lying. Giving her hope. But she deserves honesty.

"I don't know. But I know we'll fight. That's all we can control."

"And if we lose?"

"Then we lose fighting. That matters."

She nods, returns to firing. Dmitri moves on.

Minutes later, a sniper shot. Dmitri hears the impact, turns back. Anya is down. He runs to her position.

She's been hit in the chest. Fatal wound. She's dying.

Dmitri holds her, trying to stop the bleeding. But there's too much blood. Too much damage.

Anya looks at him. "Sir... did I do good?"

"You did great. You're a hero."

"Tell my family... tell them I fought well."

"I will. I promise."

She smiles. Then she's gone.

Dmitri sits there, holding her body, surrounded by gunfire and explosions. She was twenty-one years old. She survived six weeks of war. And now she's dead. One more casualty. One more name on the list.

He thinks: "How many more? How many more before this ends?"

He doesn't have an answer.

He calls for medics to retrieve her body, then returns to command. Because the battle continues. Because soldiers are still fighting. Because he's their commander and they need him.

But something breaks inside him. He's been strong for six weeks. He's led his troops through hell. He's made impossible decisions. But watching Anya die—that breaks something.

He radios Nikolai in the central tower. His brother answers immediately.

"Dmitri? Status?"

"We're holding. Barely. Casualties are heavy. Anya's dead."

Silence. Nikolai knew Anya. They all did.

"I'm sorry."

"Me too. Nikolai, I don't know how much longer we can hold. They're overwhelming us."

"You have to hold. If the outer ring falls, they reach the tower. If they reach the tower, they get The Judge."

"I know. But my soldiers are dying. How many more have to die?"

"As many as it takes. I'm sorry, brother. But that's the truth."

Dmitri knows he's right. But it doesn't make it easier.

The battle rages for eighteen hours. SFW throws everything at the defensive ring. Dmitri's forces hold. Barely. But they hold.

By nightfall, SFW withdraws to regroup. Dmitri assesses the damage: three hundred soldiers dead. Five hundred wounded. Defensive positions damaged. Ammunition running low. Morale collapsing.

They can't sustain this. Another day like today and the defensive ring breaks.

He calls a meeting with his officers. They're exhausted, traumatized, barely functional.

"Status reports."

The reports are grim. Every sector took heavy casualties. Every position is undermanned. Every unit is low on supplies.

One officer—Captain Ivanov, veteran of the entire war—speaks up: "Commander, we can't hold another assault like today. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the ammunition. We don't have the strength."

Dmitri: "Then what do you suggest?"

"Withdraw to the inner defensive ring. Consolidate forces. Make them fight for every meter."

"That means abandoning the outer ring. Letting them get closer to the tower."

"Yes. But it means we survive to keep fighting."

Dmitri considers this. It's sound tactics. But it's also retreat. And retreat feels like failure.

He thinks about his family. Alexei, somewhere behind enemy lines, conducting sabotage. Elena, coordinating resistance. Nikolai, in the tower with The Judge. The Volkov family scattered across a war zone.

He thinks about Anya. About the three hundred soldiers who died today. About the thousands who've died over six weeks. All to protect The Judge. All to defend Veridica.

Is it worth it? He doesn't know anymore.

But he knows they can't quit. Not while they can still fight.

"We hold the outer ring. One more day. If SFW breaks through tomorrow, we withdraw to inner ring. But not before."

The officers accept this. They don't like it. But they accept it.

That night, Dmitri walks the defensive positions. His soldiers are resting, eating, treating wounds. They're exhausted. But they're still here. Still fighting.

He thinks of old battles. Stalingrad. Thermopylae. The Alamo. Last stands that mattered. Last stands that became legend.

Maybe this is their last stand. Maybe they'll all die here. But they'll die fighting. And that matters.

He thinks of a song: "The Last Stand" by Sabaton. "For the grace, for the might of our Lord / For the home of the holy / For the faith, for the way of the sword / Gave their lives so boldly."

They're giving their lives. For Veridica. For The Judge. For each other. That has to mean something.

The chapter ends with Dmitri preparing for the next day's battle. He knows it will be worse than today. He knows more will die. Maybe he'll die.

But he'll fight. Because that's what he does. Because that's what Volkovs do. Because someone has to.

He thinks of Anya's last words: "Did I do good?"

Yes. She did good. They all did good. And tomorrow, they'll do good again.

Until they can't.
