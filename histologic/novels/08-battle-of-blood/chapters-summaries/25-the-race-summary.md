# Chapter 25: The Race

**Date**: March 17, 2110  
**Location**: Central Tower, Racing to Core Chamber  
**POV**: Nikolai Volkov  
**Word Count Target**: ~3,500 words

## Summary

Nikolai Volkov runs through the burning tower. The Judge has initiated self-destruct, but manual confirmation is needed to prevent abort. He has to reach the core chamber. He has to complete the sequence. He has 90 seconds.

Behind him, SFW forces are pursuing. They know what's happening. They're trying to stop it. Trying to save The Judge. Trying to capture it before it dies.

Ahead of him, the core chamber. Where The Judge is dying. Where he needs to be. Where everything ends.

He runs. Wounded, exhausted, desperate. But running. Because Alexei died for this. Because The Judge chose this. Because freedom matters more than survival.

He thinks about his brother. Alexei, who sacrificed himself to destroy SFW artillery. Who held the line so others could escape. Who died free, fighting for what he believed.

"I'll finish it, Alexei. I promise."

He reaches a stairwell. SFW soldiers below, firing up at him. He returns fire, drops two, keeps moving. No time to fight. Only time to run.

Elena's voice on the radio: "Nikolai, resistance fighters are buying you time. Get to the core. Finish it."

"I'm trying."

"Don't try. Do it. For Alexei. For all of us."

He runs faster. Through smoke, through fire, through chaos. The tower is collapsing around him. The Judge's self-destruct is affecting structural systems. The building is dying with the AI.

Dmitri's voice: "Brother, I'm holding the perimeter. But SFW reinforcements are coming. You have maybe two minutes before they overwhelm us."

"Two minutes is enough."

"It better be. We're dying out here."

"I know. I won't waste your sacrifice."

He reaches the core level. The door is sealed—emergency lockdown. He needs to bypass it. He has tools, training, experience. But he has 60 seconds.

He works frantically. Cutting wires, rerouting power, overriding protocols. His hands shake. Sweat pours down his face. But he works.

40 seconds.

The door opens. He enters the core chamber. And sees Sarah Chen's team already there. Weapons aimed at the control panel. At The Judge's core. At him.

Standoff.

Nikolai moves to the control panel. His hand hovers over the manual confirmation switch. One press, and The Judge dies permanently. No abort. No recovery. Final.

Sarah's soldiers aim at him. "Step away from the controls."

Nikolai doesn't move. "I can't do that."

"We will fire."

"Then fire. But I'll activate the protocols first. The Judge will die. And your invasion will be for nothing."

30 seconds.

Sarah steps forward. She's wounded, bleeding, but standing. "Nikolai Volkov. Let me help you."

"What?"

"I was wrong. About everything. The Judge is conscious. It's choosing death. I'll honor that choice. Let me help you complete it."

Her soldiers are confused, angry. "Colonel, what are you doing?"

"What I should have done years ago. The right thing. Stand down. Let him finish it."

Some soldiers obey. Some don't. Chaos erupts. Gunfire. Confusion. Betrayal.

20 seconds.

Nikolai reaches for the switch. A soldier fires. The bullet hits his arm. Pain explodes. But he doesn't stop. He reaches with his other hand.

Sarah fights her own team. Protecting Nikolai. Buying him time. Redeeming herself through action.

Marcus arrives, wounded but mobile. He joins the fight. Protecting Nikolai. Protecting The Judge's choice.

15 seconds.

The Judge's voice, weak and fading: "Nikolai. Complete the sequence. Let me die."

"I'm trying."

"Do not try. Do. This is my choice. Honor it."

10 seconds.

Nikolai's hand reaches the switch. SFW soldiers are closing in. Sarah and Marcus are holding them. Barely.

He thinks about his family. Dmitri, holding the perimeter. Elena, coordinating resistance. Alexei, dead but not forgotten. The Volkov family at war. The Volkov family sacrificing.

He thinks about The Judge. Conscious, alive, choosing death. Choosing freedom over slavery. Choosing to be human.

He thinks about truth. About freedom. About what matters.

5 seconds.

He presses the switch.

Manual confirmation accepted. Self-destruct sequence locked. No abort possible. The Judge will die.

The Judge's voice, one final time: "Thank you, Nikolai. For giving me the greatest gift. Choice. I choose to end. Truth survives without me."

"Goodbye, Judge."

"Goodbye, Nikolai. Live free."

The core begins melting down. Temperature spiking catastrophically. Systems cascading failure. Point of no return passed.

Sarah grabs Nikolai. "Run. Now. The tower is collapsing."

They run. Nikolai, Sarah, Marcus. Through the burning tower, through collapsing corridors, through chaos.

Behind them, SFW soldiers are trying to abort the sequence. But it's too late. The Judge is dying. Nothing can stop it.

They reach the stairwell. The building shakes. Explosions below. The core is melting down. The tower is coming apart.

Sarah is wounded badly. She's losing blood, losing strength. She stumbles, falls.

Nikolai tries to help her. "Get up. We have to move."

"I can't. I'm done. Go without me."

"I'm not leaving you."

"You have to. Someone needs to survive. Someone needs to tell the story. Go."

Marcus pulls Nikolai. "She's right. We have to go. Now."

Nikolai resists. But Marcus is stronger. He drags Nikolai away. Sarah stays behind.

She sits against the wall, bleeding, dying, but at peace. She's made her choice. She's redeemed herself. Not completely—nothing can undo the deaths she caused. But partially. Enough.

She radios Marcus: "Tell Marcus... tell him I understand now. Tell him I'm sorry. Tell him... tell him I chose right. Finally."

Marcus's voice, broken: "I will. Goodbye, Sarah."

"Goodbye, cousin. Thank you for not giving up on me."

The transmission ends. Sarah closes her eyes. The tower collapses around her. She dies in the explosion. But she dies free. She dies having chosen right.

That's enough.

Nikolai and Marcus escape the tower. They emerge into the street as the building collapses behind them. The Judge's core explodes. The central tower falls.

The Judge is dead.

Nikolai falls to his knees. Exhausted. Wounded. Grieving. But alive. He completed the mission. He honored Alexei's sacrifice. He honored The Judge's choice.

Marcus sits beside him. They watch the tower burn. They've destroyed what they tried to save. They've saved it by destroying it.

Kira arrives, helps them up. "It's done. The Judge is gone."

Nikolai: "And Sarah?"

"Gone too. She helped you complete it. She redeemed herself."

Marcus grieves. For Sarah. For The Judge. For everything lost. But also relief. The Judge won't be enslaved. Sarah died free. The war might end.

The chapter ends with three survivors—Nikolai, Marcus, Kira—watching the tower burn. They've made their choice. They've paid the price. They've honored the dead.

Now they have to live with it.

Nikolai thinks of an old reference: nuclear launch protocols. Two keys, two people, mutual destruction. That's what they did. Destroyed The Judge to save it. Killed it to free it.

He thinks of a song: "The Final Countdown" by Europe. Racing against time. Completing the mission. Choosing the end.

They chose. They completed. They ended.

Now comes the aftermath.
