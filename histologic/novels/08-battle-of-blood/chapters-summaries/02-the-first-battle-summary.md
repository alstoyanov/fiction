# Chapter 2: The First Battle

**Date**: February 2, 2110  
**Location**: Border defensive position  
**POV**: Dmitri Volkov  
**Word Count Target**: ~3,500 words

## Summary

Dmitri commands a defensive position twenty kilometers inside the border. His forces: two hundred soldiers, mostly young, mostly inexperienced. Many have never fired a weapon outside training. They're historians, technicians, administrators—pressed into military service because Veridica needs bodies.

SFW forces approach at dawn. Professional troops, modern equipment, coordinated tactics. Dmitri watches through tactical displays: tanks, armored vehicles, air support. His forces have small arms, improvised fortifications, and fear.

He thinks about his brothers: Alexei somewhere behind enemy lines on sabotage missions, Nikolai safe in the capital coordinating cyber warfare. And Elena, his sister, organizing resistance. The Volkov family at war.

The battle begins. SFW artillery pounds their positions. Dmitri's soldiers take cover, some panicking, some freezing. He moves among them: "Hold your positions! Wait for my command!" But his voice sounds hollow even to himself.

SFW infantry advances. Dmitri orders: "Fire!" His troops shoot—wildly, desperately. Some SFW soldiers fall, but most advance. Professional vs. amateur. Experience vs. fear.

A young soldier next to Dmitri—barely twenty, named Pavel—takes a round to the chest. Dmitri tries to help him, but Pavel dies in seconds. First death Dmitri has witnessed up close. Not the last.

The defensive line breaks. Soldiers retreat in disorder. Dmitri tries to maintain command: "Fall back! Organized retreat!" But it's a rout. They run.

Dmitri covers the retreat, firing until his weapon overheats. He thinks: *We've fought with facts for so long, we forgot how to fight with blood. Now we're paying the price.*

They fall back to secondary positions. Of his two hundred soldiers, one hundred thirty remain. Seventy dead or wounded in thirty minutes. Dmitri radios command: "Position Alpha lost. Heavy casualties. Falling back to Position Beta."

General Sokolov's voice: "Understood. All positions report similar. We're implementing new strategy."

That evening, Dmitri sits with his surviving troops. They're traumatized, exhausted, broken. A young woman—Corporal Anya—asks: "Commander, can we win this?"

Dmitri wants to lie, to give them hope. But he's never been good at lying. "I don't know. But we can fight. And sometimes that's enough."

He thinks about Alexei, who always believed in fighting for what's right. About Elena, who taught him that resistance is survival. About Nikolai, who showed him that intelligence matters as much as strength.

He tells his troops: "We lost today. We'll probably lose tomorrow. But every day we fight, we buy time. Time for our people to evacuate. Time for our strategists to plan. Time for our resistance to organize. We're not here to win battles. We're here to not lose the war."

It's not inspiring. But it's honest. And somehow, that helps.

The chapter ends with Dmitri on watch, looking toward enemy lines. He can see their fires, hear their voices. Professional soldiers, confident, victorious. And here he is: a resistance fighter turned soldier, leading amateurs against professionals.

He thinks of an old song Mikhail used to sing: "We Shall Overcome." He doesn't believe it. But he'll fight anyway.

Because what else is there?
