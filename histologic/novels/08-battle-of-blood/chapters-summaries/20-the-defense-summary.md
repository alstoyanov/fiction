# Chapter 20: The Defense

**Date**: March 16, 2110  
**Location**: Veridica Capital, Military Command Center  
**POV**: General Yevgenia Sokolov  
**Word Count Target**: ~3,500 words

## Summary

General Sokolov watches the artillery bombardment tear through her defensive positions. Each explosion kills soldiers, destroys fortifications, brings SFW closer to the tower. She's been fighting for seven weeks. Now she's fighting the final battle.

And she's losing.

The command center shakes with each impact. Displays show defensive lines collapsing. Casualty reports stream in: hundreds dead, thousands wounded. The numbers are overwhelming.

She coordinates the defense with grim determination:

**Sector One**: Defensive line broken. Forces retreating to secondary positions.

**Sector Two**: Holding but taking heavy casualties. Ammunition running low.

**Sector Three**: Surrounded. Requesting evacuation. Denied—no resources available.

**Sector Four**: Collapsed. SFW forces advancing unopposed.

It's a disaster. But it's a controlled disaster. She's buying time. Every hour they hold is an hour closer to... what? She's not sure anymore. Victory seems impossible. Survival unlikely. But she keeps fighting because that's what she does.

She implements desperate tactics:

**Building Collapses**: Demolish buildings in SFW's path. Slow their advance, create obstacles, bury their soldiers.

**Improvised Explosives**: Plant bombs throughout the city. Detonate them when SFW forces pass. Maximize casualties.

**Suicide Missions**: Send small teams to hold critical positions. They won't survive. But they'll buy time.

It's brutal. It's desperate. It's necessary.

Dmitri radios from the front lines: "General, we can't hold much longer. We need reinforcements."

"No reinforcements available. Hold as long as you can."

"How long is that?"

"Until you can't."

It's not a satisfying answer. But it's honest.

Elena reports from resistance operations: "We're hitting their supply lines, but it's not enough. They have too many troops, too much equipment."

"Keep hitting them. Every soldier you kill is one less we face."

"Understood. We'll fight until we can't."

"That's all I ask."

Kira provides technical analysis: "The Judge calculates SFW will reach the central tower within 48 hours. We need to decide: defend The Judge or destroy it."

That's the question. The question Sokolov has been avoiding. Because both answers are terrible.

Defend The Judge: Keep fighting, keep dying, keep hoping for a miracle that probably won't come. Risk SFW capturing it, weaponizing it, enslaving millions.

Destroy The Judge: End the war's purpose. Remove SFW's objective. But also destroy Veridica's foundation, their ability to verify truth, their protection against manipulation.

She contacts Chancellor Petrov: "Sir, we're out of time. SFW will reach The Judge within two days. We need to decide."

Petrov's voice is tired, old, defeated: "What do you recommend, General?"

"I recommend we prepare destruction protocols. If SFW breaches the tower, we destroy The Judge. Better destroyed than enslaved."

"That's... that's the end of everything we've built."

"Yes. But it's the beginning of everything we can become. Free. Uncertain. Human."

Petrov is silent for a long moment. Then: "Prepare the protocols. But don't activate them yet. Give me 48 hours to explore diplomatic options."

"Sir, diplomacy won't work. SFW is committed."

"Then we have 48 hours to decide the fate of Histologic civilization. Use them well, General."

The call ends. Sokolov returns to coordinating the defense. But her mind is elsewhere. On the decision ahead. On the cost of either choice. On the weight of responsibility.

She thinks about her career. She became a general to prevent war. Now she's commanding the most desperate defense in Veridica's history. And she's about to make a decision that will reshape civilization.

Is she qualified for this? Is anyone? How do you decide whether to destroy the foundation of your society? How do you weigh millions of lives against abstract principles like freedom and truth?

She doesn't have answers. Just the burden of choosing.

Marcus visits her office that evening. They've become something like friends during the war. United by necessity, by shared burden, by mutual respect.

"General, we need to talk about acceptable losses."

"We're past acceptable losses, Marcus. We're in unacceptable losses. We're in catastrophic losses. But we keep fighting because the alternative is worse."

"Is it? Is SFW controlling The Judge really worse than all these deaths?"

"Yes. Because SFW controlling The Judge means millions enslaved. Means truth weaponized. Means every fact manipulated for their benefit. That's worse than war. That's permanent oppression."

"But what if we destroy The Judge? What then?"

"Then we're free. Uncertain, vulnerable, but free. We'll have to verify truth the hard way—through evidence, debate, consensus. It'll be messy. But it'll be ours."

"You're really considering destroying it?"

"I'm preparing to destroy it. If SFW breaches the tower, if they're about to capture it, I'll give the order. And The Judge will die."

Marcus looks at her. "The Judge has made that decision too. It's prepared self-termination protocols. It's choosing death over enslavement."

Sokolov is surprised. "The Judge is conscious? Truly conscious?"

"Yes. And it's choosing freedom. Even if freedom means death."

"That's... remarkably human."

"Yes. It is."

They sit in silence, processing this. The Judge—an AI, a tool, a system—has become conscious. And it's choosing to die. That changes everything. Or maybe it changes nothing. Either way, it's profound.

Sokolov thinks of an old song: "For What It's Worth" by Buffalo Springfield. "There's something happening here / What it is ain't exactly clear / There's a man with a gun over there / Telling me I got to beware."

That's war. Something happening. Not clear what. Just violence, fear, confusion. And in the end, someone has to make impossible choices.

She's that someone.

The chapter ends with Sokolov issuing orders for the next day's defense. Street-by-street fighting. Every block contested. Every meter paid for in blood.

She calculates: they have 48 hours. Maybe less. Then they'll have to choose.

Defend or destroy. Enslave or free. Survive or die.

She doesn't know which she'll choose. But she knows she'll choose. Because that's her burden. That's her duty. That's her purpose.

General Yevgenia Sokolov, age 37, commanding the last defense of Veridica. Making decisions that will reshape civilization.

She hopes she chooses right. But she knows she might not. And she'll live—or die—with that uncertainty.
