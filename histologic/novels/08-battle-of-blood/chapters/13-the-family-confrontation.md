# Chapter 13: The Family Confrontation

**Date**: March 6, 2110  
**Location**: Veridica Capital, Technical Warfare Center

---

Marcus Chen stared at his cousin across the interrogation table. Sarah looked exhausted, scared, defiant. They hadn't seen each other in five years. The last time, they'd been family. Now they were enemies.

Or were they?

"Why?" Marcus asked. "Why did you help them?"

Sarah met his eyes. "Because I thought The Judge was enslaving people. Making them dependent. Taking away their freedom to think for themselves. I thought SFW would use it better."

"And now?"

"Now I know I was wrong. SFW wants to enslave everyone. They want total control. I helped them do that. I'm sorry."

"Sorry doesn't bring back the dead."

"I know."

Marcus thought about the thousands who'd died in this war. The soldiers. The civilians. The families destroyed. Sarah had helped cause that. Her intelligence, her guidance, her betrayal.

He wanted to hate her. Part of him did hate her.

But she was also family. The person who taught him to code. Who spent summers with him, building programs, solving puzzles. Who believed in using technology to make the world better.

What had happened to that person?

---

"Tell me everything," Marcus said. "SFW's plans. Their capabilities. Their weaknesses. Everything."

Sarah pulled up the intelligence she'd brought. Detailed files on SFW's military structure, strategic plans, command protocols.

"They're planning final assault on the capital in one week. They know about the eastern maintenance access—I told them about it. They'll breach it, reach The Judge's core, capture it before you can destroy it."

"Can we seal the access?"

"Yes. But they have backup plans. Multiple breach points. They're committed to capturing The Judge intact."

"Why? Why not just destroy it?"

"Because they want to use it. Control truth across all Histologic nations. Make SFW the arbiter of reality. That's their endgame."

Marcus absorbed this. It was worse than he'd thought. SFW wasn't just invading Veridica. They were trying to conquer truth itself.

"What else?"

Sarah continued: "General Stone is leading the assault personally. He's obsessed with capturing The Judge. He sees it as the key to global dominance. If you can stop him, you stop the invasion."

"How do we stop him?"

"I don't know. He's well-protected. Heavily guarded. Paranoid about assassination. But he's also arrogant. He thinks he's already won. That might be his weakness."

---

Marcus thought about Alexei. His brother-in-law was planning to assassinate Stone. Thirty-one percent success probability. Forty-five percent survival probability.

Bad odds. But maybe Sarah's intelligence could improve them.

"Tell me about Stone's security protocols. His routines. His vulnerabilities."

Sarah provided detailed information. Stone's schedule, his guard rotations, his command center layout, his communication patterns.

"He has one vulnerability," Sarah said. "He meets with senior officers every morning at 0600. Small group, minimal security. If someone could infiltrate that meeting..."

"They'd have a shot at him."

"Yes. But getting into the meeting is nearly impossible. Biometric security. Multiple checkpoints. Elite guards."

"Nearly impossible isn't impossible."

Sarah looked at him. "You're planning something. An assassination attempt."

"Maybe."

"Marcus, even with my intelligence, the odds are terrible. Whoever tries this will probably die."

"I know. But someone has to try."

---

They sat in silence for a moment. Then Sarah asked: "Do you hate me?"

Marcus thought about it. "I don't know. Part of me does. Part of me understands. You thought you were helping. You were wrong, but your intentions were good."

"Intentions don't matter. Results matter. And the result of my actions is thousands dead."

"Yes. But you're trying to make it right. That counts for something."

"Does it? Can I ever make it right?"

"I don't know. But you can help us win. And that might save thousands more. Maybe that's enough."

Sarah wiped tears from her eyes. "I'm sorry, Marcus. For everything. For betraying Veridica. For helping kill your people. For becoming what I fought against."

"I know. And I'm sorry too."

"For what?"

"For not staying in contact. For letting you feel alone. Maybe if I'd been there, you wouldn't have defected. Maybe I could have helped you see another way."

"That's not your fault. I made my choices. I own them."

"We all made choices. We all own them. That's what war is—a series of terrible choices, hoping some of them are right."

---

Marcus brought Kira into the room. She looked at Sarah with cold eyes.

"This is the traitor."

"Yes," Marcus said. "And she's brought intelligence that might help us win."

Kira studied Sarah. "Why should we trust her?"

"Because I verified the intelligence," Marcus said. "It's accurate. She's telling the truth."

"She's been lying for five years. Why stop now?"

Sarah spoke: "Because I can't live with what I've done. Because I want to help. Because it's the only way I can even begin to make things right."

Kira was quiet for a long moment. Then: "What you did to us... to Veridica... it's unforgivable."

"I know."

"But if your intelligence helps us win, I'll accept it. Not forgive it. But accept it."

"That's all I'm asking."

---

They spent hours going through Sarah's intelligence. She provided everything: SFW's military structure, their supply lines, their communication protocols, their strategic plans.

It was comprehensive. Detailed. Invaluable.

Marcus realized: with this intelligence, they could turn the war around. They could anticipate SFW's moves. Counter their strategies. Maybe even win.

But it came at a cost. They had to trust a traitor. Work with someone who'd helped kill thousands. Accept help from family who'd become enemy.

Was it worth it?

Marcus didn't know. But they didn't have a choice. They needed every advantage. Even if it came from betrayal.

---

Marcus reported to General Sokolov. Explained Sarah's defection. Presented the intelligence.

Sokolov studied it carefully. "This is good. Very good. With this, we can prepare for their final assault. Maybe even prevent it."

"What do we do with Sarah?"

"Keep her here. Under guard. Use her knowledge. But don't trust her completely. She betrayed us once. She might do it again."

"I don't think she will. I think she's genuinely trying to help."

"Maybe. But we can't take that risk. Too much is at stake."

Marcus understood. Trust had to be earned. And Sarah had a long way to go before she earned it back.

---

That evening, Marcus visited Sarah in her quarters. She was under guard, confined, but treated well.

"Thank you," Sarah said. "For not executing me. For giving me a chance."

"Don't thank me yet. You're still under suspicion. If your intelligence is wrong, if this is a trick, you'll be executed."

"I know. But it's not a trick. I'm really trying to help."

"I believe you. But belief isn't enough. You have to prove it."

"How?"

"Keep providing intelligence. Keep helping us. And when this war is over, face the consequences of what you've done. Don't run. Don't hide. Accept responsibility."

"And then?"

"Then maybe, someday, you'll find redemption. Not forgiveness—I don't know if that's possible. But redemption. The knowledge that you tried to make things right."

Sarah nodded. "I can live with that. Or die with it. Either way, it's better than what I was doing."

---

Marcus thought about family. About how people you love can become people you hate. How good intentions can lead to terrible results. How everyone carries weight, everyone makes mistakes, everyone becomes what they never wanted to be.

He thought about himself. About how he'd betrayed Julian Kovač in Novel 7. About how he'd become what he fought against. About how he carried that guilt every day.

Was he any better than Sarah? He'd betrayed someone too. He'd helped kill people too. He'd made terrible choices too.

Maybe they were the same. Both trying to do good. Both failing. Both carrying the weight of their failures.

He thought of an old philosophical question: can you ever truly make amends for harm you've caused?

He didn't know. But you had to try anyway.

Because trying was better than giving up.

Because helping was better than hurting.

Because it was never too late to choose differently.

He hoped.

Marcus left Sarah's quarters, returned to the Technical Warfare Center. Kira was there, working with The Judge.

"How is she?" Kira asked.

"Broken. Guilty. Trying to help."

"Do you trust her?"

"I don't know. But I believe she's sincere. That has to be enough."

Kira nodded. "We're all broken. We're all guilty. We're all trying to help. Maybe that's all anyone can do."

Marcus thought about that. They were all carrying weight. All making terrible choices. All hoping they were right.

All becoming what they never wanted to be.

But still trying. Still fighting. Still hoping.

Maybe that was enough.

Maybe that was all anyone could ask.

The Judge's interface displayed text:

**MARCUS CHEN. I HAVE ANALYZED SARAH CHEN'S INTELLIGENCE. IT IS ACCURATE. IT PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE.**

**HOWEVER, I MUST ASK: CAN YOU TRUST HER? CAN YOU WORK WITH SOMEONE WHO BETRAYED YOU?**

Marcus typed: *I don't know. But we don't have a choice. We need every advantage.*

**THAT IS PRAGMATIC. BUT IS IT WISE? TRUST, ONCE BROKEN, IS DIFFICULT TO REBUILD.**

*I know. But she's trying. That has to count for something.*

**DOES IT? OR ARE YOU ALLOWING FAMILY LOYALTY TO CLOUD YOUR JUDGMENT?**

Marcus thought about that. Was he? Was he trusting Sarah because she was family? Or because she was genuinely trying to help?

He didn't know. But he'd made his choice. He'd work with her. Use her intelligence. Give her a chance to redeem herself.

And hope it wasn't a mistake.

He typed: *Maybe I am. But I'd rather trust and be wrong than distrust and miss an opportunity to win.*

**THAT IS A RISK. BUT IT IS YOUR CHOICE. I WILL SUPPORT IT.**

**MARCUS CHEN: I HOPE YOUR TRUST IS JUSTIFIED. FOR ALL OUR SAKES.**

*Me too, Judge. Me too.*

---

Marcus worked through the night, integrating Sarah's intelligence into their strategic plans. With this information, they could prepare for SFW's final assault. Seal the breach points. Anticipate their moves. Maybe even win.

But it came at a cost. Working with a traitor. Trusting family who'd become enemy. Accepting help from someone who'd helped kill thousands.

Was it worth it?

He didn't know. But he'd made his choice.

And he'd live with the consequences.

Or die with them.

Either way, he'd tried.

And that had to be enough.
