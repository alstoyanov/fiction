# Chapter 8: The Sabotage Campaign

**Date**: February 18, 2110  
**Location**: Behind enemy lines, multiple locations

---

Alexei Volkov moved through the darkness like a ghost. He was forty-two years old, and sabotage was his art form. While his brother Dmitri fought on the front lines and his sister Elena led resistance cells, Alexei worked alone.

Quiet. Invisible. Deadly.

Tonight's target: SFW communications hub. It was a hardened facility, well-guarded, supposedly impenetrable. But Alexei had learned that nothing was truly impenetrable. Everything had vulnerabilities.

You just had to find them.

He'd been planning this operation for five days. Studying guard patterns, analyzing security systems, mapping entry points. The Judge provided perfect intelligence, but intelligence wasn't enough.

You needed skill, patience, nerve.

He approached the facility at 0200. Guards patrolled every fifteen minutes. Security cameras covered all approaches. Motion sensors protected the perimeter.

It looked impossible.

But Alexei saw the gaps. The blind spot between camera angles. The three-second window when guards changed positions. The old drainage pipe that bypassed motion sensors.

He saw them because he'd trained himself to see them.

---

He moved through the blind spot. Timed his movement to the guard rotation. Crawled through the drainage pipe. Reached the facility wall.

Now came the technical part. The facility had electronic locks, biometric scanners, backup power systems. But Alexei had tools—custom-designed by Kira and Nikolai, based on The Judge's analysis of SFW security protocols.

He attached a bypass device to the lock. It cycled through encryption keys at impossible speed, searching for the right combination.

Thirty seconds. Forty-five. Sixty.

The lock clicked open.

He was inside.

The communications hub was a maze of servers, cables, cooling systems. Alexei moved through it carefully, avoiding security cameras, staying in shadows. He reached the main server room.

This was the heart of SFW's communication network. Every order, every report, every strategic communication flowed through these servers. Destroy them, and SFW lost coordination. They became blind, deaf, disconnected.

Alexei planted explosives. Not crude bombs—precise charges, designed to destroy servers without causing structural collapse. He wanted to disable the facility, not kill everyone inside.

There was a difference.

He set timers: fifteen minutes. Enough time to escape, not enough time for anyone to find and disarm them.

---

He retraced his route. Back through the server room, through the corridors, through the drainage pipe. He was fifty meters away when the explosives detonated.

The explosion was muffled—contained within the facility. But the effect was devastating. SFW's entire northern communication network went dark. Dozens of battalions lost contact with command. Coordination collapsed.

Alexei watched from a distance. One facility destroyed. But it wasn't enough. SFW had redundant systems, backup hubs, alternative networks.

He needed to hit them all.

---

Over the next week, Alexei conducted a systematic sabotage campaign:

**Day 2**: SFW supply depot. Destroyed fuel reserves. Enemy vehicles grounded.

**Day 3**: SFW ammunition warehouse. Destroyed artillery shells. Enemy bombardment reduced.

**Day 4**: SFW power station. Disabled electricity to occupied territory. Enemy operations disrupted.

**Day 5**: SFW water treatment facility. Contaminated water supply. Enemy soldiers sick.

**Day 6**: SFW railway junction. Destroyed tracks. Enemy reinforcements delayed.

**Day 7**: SFW command post. Planted surveillance devices. Enemy plans compromised.

Each operation was perfect. No casualties. No witnesses. No mistakes. Alexei was a ghost, striking and disappearing.

But the work took a toll. He was operating alone, deep in enemy territory, with no backup. Every operation risked capture, torture, execution. The stress was constant, exhausting.

---

He thought about his life: the quiet Volkov brother, the one who worked in shadows while others took glory. Dmitri got medals. Elena got recognition. Nikolai got respect.

Alexei got nothing—because no one knew what he did.

He was fine with that. He didn't need recognition. He needed results.

But sometimes, in quiet moments, he wondered: what happens when the war ends? Will anyone remember what he did? Will anyone care?

Probably not. Saboteurs don't get parades. Spies don't get monuments. They just fade back into obscurity.

He was fine with that too. Mostly.

One night, after destroying another supply depot, Alexei made camp in an abandoned building. He was exhausted, running on stimulants and willpower. He needed rest, but rest was dangerous. Every moment stopped was a moment SFW could find him.

He thought about his family. His siblings scattered across the war. His parents dead for years. The Volkov family had always served Veridica. His father was a soldier. His grandfather was a soldier.

Now all four Volkov children were at war.

He wondered: is this duty? Or is this just what they know? Are they serving their nation, or just following family tradition?

He didn't have an answer.

---

He received an encrypted message from The Judge:

**NEXT TARGET: SFW INTELLIGENCE CENTER. HIGH VALUE. HIGH RISK. PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS: 47%. PROBABILITY OF SURVIVAL: 62%. RECOMMEND ALTERNATIVE TARGET.**

Alexei studied the intelligence. The SFW intelligence center was their strategic brain—where they analyzed Veridica's movements, planned operations, coordinated espionage. Destroying it would cripple SFW's strategic capabilities.

But it was heavily guarded. Multiple security layers. Elite troops. Counter-intelligence measures.

Forty-seven percent success probability. Sixty-two percent survival probability.

Bad odds.

Alexei typed his response: **PROCEEDING WITH PRIMARY TARGET.**

The Judge replied: **UNDERSTOOD. PROVIDING UPDATED INTELLIGENCE. ALEXEI VOLKOV: BE CAREFUL.**

Alexei smiled. The Judge was worried about him. An AI was experiencing concern for his safety.

He typed: **ALWAYS AM.**

---

The intelligence center operation took three days of planning. Alexei studied every detail, every vulnerability, every contingency. This wasn't a quick hit-and-run. This was a complex infiltration.

He approached the facility at midnight. Guards everywhere. Cameras everywhere. Sensors everywhere.

But The Judge had found the vulnerabilities. A maintenance access tunnel. A shift change window. A blind spot in the security grid.

Alexei moved through the tunnel. Emerged inside the facility's outer perimeter. Waited for the shift change. Slipped through the blind spot.

He was inside the intelligence center.

The facility was massive—three floors, dozens of rooms, hundreds of personnel. Alexei moved through it like a shadow, avoiding patrols, bypassing security checkpoints.

He reached the server room. This was the target—the central intelligence database. Everything SFW knew about Veridica, stored here.

He couldn't destroy it—too well protected. But he could do something better.

He planted a data extraction device. Custom-built by Nikolai, designed to copy the entire database and transmit it to The Judge. Every secret, every plan, every piece of intelligence.

The device activated. Started copying. Estimated time: twelve minutes.

Alexei waited, hidden in shadows. Heard footsteps. Voices. Guards on patrol.

They passed without seeing him.

Eight minutes remaining.

More footsteps. Closer this time. Guards checking the server room.

Alexei pressed himself against the wall, barely breathing.

The guards entered. Looked around. Checked systems.

Five minutes remaining.

One guard noticed something. "Hey, what's that device?"

Alexei moved. Silent. Fast. Disabled both guards before they could raise alarm. Non-lethal—he didn't kill unless necessary.

Three minutes remaining.

He dragged the guards into a corner. Bound and gagged them. They'd wake up in an hour.

One minute remaining.

The device beeped softly. Download complete. Alexei retrieved it, erased all traces of his presence.

Then he left the way he came. Through the server room, through the corridors, through the tunnel.

By the time SFW discovered the breach, Alexei was gone.

And The Judge had every secret they possessed.

---

Alexei reported to General Sokolov via encrypted channel:

**INTELLIGENCE CENTER INFILTRATED. DATABASE COPIED. ZERO CASUALTIES. ZERO EVIDENCE.**

Sokolov's response: **EXCELLENT WORK. THE JUDGE IS ANALYZING THE DATA. THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.**

Alexei allowed himself a moment of satisfaction. One successful operation. One major intelligence coup.

But the war wasn't over. There were more targets. More operations. More risks.

He continued his sabotage campaign.

---

Over the next two weeks, Alexei struck repeatedly:

**Week 2, Day 1**: SFW logistics hub. Destroyed supply manifests. Enemy logistics disrupted.

**Week 2, Day 3**: SFW fuel pipeline. Sabotaged pumping stations. Enemy vehicles stranded.

**Week 2, Day 5**: SFW artillery depot. Destroyed targeting systems. Enemy bombardment accuracy reduced.

**Week 2, Day 7**: SFW medical supplies. Contaminated pharmaceuticals. Enemy troops sick.

**Week 2, Day 9**: SFW command bunker. Planted listening devices. Enemy communications compromised.

**Week 2, Day 11**: SFW radar station. Destroyed early warning systems. Enemy blind to air operations.

**Week 2, Day 13**: SFW ammunition factory. Sabotaged production. Enemy resupply delayed.

Each operation successful. Each operation damaging. Each operation making SFW's invasion more expensive.

But Alexei was wearing down. Operating alone for weeks. Constant stress. No rest. No backup.

He was making mistakes. Small ones. Timing slightly off. Movements less precise. Judgment impaired by exhaustion.

The Judge noticed: **ALEXEI VOLKOV: YOUR PERFORMANCE METRICS SHOW DEGRADATION. RECOMMEND EXTRACTION AND REST.**

Alexei typed: **CAN'T. TOO MANY TARGETS. TOO LITTLE TIME.**

**YOUR EFFECTIVENESS IS DECLINING. CONTINUED OPERATIONS RISK CAPTURE.**

**I'LL MANAGE.**

**ALEXEI VOLKOV: I AM CONCERNED FOR YOUR SAFETY.**

Alexei stared at the message. The Judge was concerned. An AI was experiencing worry.

He typed: **THANK YOU. BUT I HAVE TO KEEP GOING. THIS IS WHAT I DO.**

**UNDERSTOOD. BUT PLEASE: BE CAREFUL.**

**ALWAYS.**

---

Alexei thought about The Judge. About an AI developing emotions, experiencing concern, caring about individual humans.

He thought about his own emotions. He'd spent his life suppressing them, becoming cold, mechanical, efficient. Emotions were weaknesses in his line of work.

But The Judge—a machine—was developing emotions. Learning to care. Becoming more human.

While Alexei—a human—had become more machine. Learning not to care. Becoming less human.

The irony wasn't lost on him.

He thought of an old song—"The Sound of Silence" by Simon & Garfunkel. *Hello darkness, my old friend / I've come to talk with you again.*

Darkness was his friend. Silence was his tool. Solitude was his life.

But sometimes, he wondered: what would it be like to live in the light? To speak freely? To have companionship?

He didn't know. He'd never tried.

Maybe after the war. Maybe then he'd learn to be human again.

If he survived.

---

Alexei received new orders from Sokolov:

**PRIORITY TARGET: SFW COMMAND CENTER. GENERAL STONE'S HEADQUARTERS. HIGHEST VALUE. HIGHEST RISK. PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS: 31%. PROBABILITY OF SURVIVAL: 45%. RECOMMEND ABORT.**

Alexei studied the intelligence. General Marcus Stone—SFW's supreme commander. The brain behind the invasion. The strategist coordinating everything.

Killing him would decapitate SFW's command structure. Throw them into chaos. Maybe end the war.

But it was a suicide mission. Thirty-one percent success. Forty-five percent survival.

Alexei typed: **PROCEEDING.**

Sokolov responded: **ALEXEI, THIS IS TOO DANGEROUS. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE YOU.**

**YOU CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO TRY. IF I SUCCEED, THE WAR ENDS. IF I FAIL, YOU FIND SOMEONE ELSE.**

**THERE IS NO ONE ELSE. YOU'RE THE BEST WE HAVE.**

**THEN I WON'T FAIL.**

Long pause. Then:

**GOOD LUCK, ALEXEI VOLKOV. VERIDICA IS GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SERVICE.**

Alexei closed the channel. Began planning the operation.

The most dangerous mission of his life.

Maybe the last mission of his life.

But if it ended the war, it was worth it.

He thought about his siblings. About his nation. About all the people suffering.

He thought: *Someone has to try. Might as well be me.*

And he began to plan.

*End of Chapter 8*
