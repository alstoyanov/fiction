# Chapter 32: The Reckoning

**Date**: April 2, 2110  
**Location**: National Memorial Cemetery

---

Dmitri Volkov stood before thousands of graves. The National Memorial Cemetery, created for war dead. Twenty-five thousand soldiers. Fifteen thousand civilians. Forty thousand graves. Forty thousand names. Forty thousand lives ended.

One of those names was Alexei Volkov.

Today was the national funeral ceremony. Honoring the fallen. Remembering the dead. Making their sacrifice meaningful—if that was possible.

Thousands attended. Soldiers, civilians, families, survivors. Chancellor Petrov would speak. General Sokolov would speak. Marcus Chen would speak. And Dmitri—he'd been asked to speak for Alexei. For his brother. For the fallen.

He stood at Alexei's grave. Simple marker. Name, dates, rank. "Alexei Volkov. Resistance Fighter. Died Free."

Died free. That's what mattered, supposedly. But Dmitri would rather have his brother alive and enslaved than dead and free. Wouldn't he?

He didn't know anymore.

The ceremony began. Petrov spoke about sacrifice, honor, freedom. Sokolov spoke about duty, courage, victory. Marcus spoke about The Judge, about choice, about meaning.

Then it was Dmitri's turn. He walked to the podium. Looked at the thousands of graves. The thousands of faces watching him. What could he say that mattered? What words were adequate?

He spoke:

"My brother Alexei believed in fighting for what's right, even when the cost is everything. He paid that cost. So did thousands of others here. Were they right? I don't know. But they believed. And they died believing. That has to mean something."

"We won this war. But we paid too much. Every grave here is too much. Every name is too much. And yet... they chose. They fought. They died free. That's not nothing."

"I don't know if it was worth it. I'll never know. No one can answer that except the dead. And they can't answer."

"But I know this: Alexei would say it was worth it. He chose to fight. He chose to sacrifice. He chose to die protecting others. That was his choice. His freedom. His life, completed on his terms."

"I'll honor that. By living. By building. By making sure their deaths weren't for nothing. By being worthy of their sacrifice."

"We can't bring them back. We can't undo their deaths. But we can honor them. By living well. By building well. By staying free. By remembering."

"Alexei, brother, I miss you. I'll always miss you. But I'll honor you. By living the life you died to protect. By being free. By choosing. By being human."

"To all the fallen: we remember you. We honor you. We will make your sacrifice meaningful. Rest well. You earned it."

He stepped down. Returned to Nikolai and Elena. The three Volkov siblings, now. United in grief, in survival, in determination.

After the ceremony, they visited Alexei's grave together. Placed flowers. Stood in silence.

Elena spoke first: "He would have hated the ceremony. Too formal. Too public."

Dmitri: "He would have loved that we're here. Together."

Nikolai: "He died so we could be free. Now we have to figure out what to do with that freedom."

They thought about this. Freedom. That's what Alexei died for. What The Judge died for. What thousands died for.

But what was freedom? The right to choose? The absence of control? The ability to make mistakes?

All of that. And more. Freedom was uncertainty. Risk. The possibility of being wrong. The responsibility of being human.

They made a pact at Alexei's grave. The three surviving Volkov siblings:

Dmitri: "I'll protect Veridica. Make sure we can defend ourselves. So no one else has to die like Alexei."

Elena: "I'll teach the next generation. Make sure they understand the cost. So they avoid war if they can."

Nikolai: "I'll build better systems. Make sure we never create another Judge. So consciousness is never forced to choose death."

They stood together. Three siblings. One loss. One purpose: honor Alexei by living well.

They thought of an old song—"The Parting Glass," an Irish folk song about death and farewell:

*Of all the comrades that e'er I had, they're sorry for my going away*  
*And all the sweethearts that e'er I had, they'd wish me one more day to stay*  
*But since it falls unto my lot, that I should rise and you should not*  
*I'll gently rise and softly call, good night and joy be to you all*

They rose. Alexei did not. But they'd carry him. In memory. In purpose. In meaning.

That was enough. It had to be enough.
