# Chapter 11: Behind Enemy Lines

**Date**: March 2, 2110  
**Location**: Occupied territory, deep behind SFW lines

---

Alexei Volkov crouched in the shadows of an abandoned warehouse, watching the SFW command post across the street. He'd been behind enemy lines for two weeks, and this was his most ambitious mission yet: destroy the command post, disrupt SFW communications, and rescue forty-three civilians detained in the building's basement.

He wasn't alone this time. Twelve resistance fighters accompanied him—volunteers from Elena's network, trained in sabotage and urban combat. They were good, but they weren't professionals. Most had been teachers, shopkeepers, office workers before the war.

Now they were soldiers. Sort of.

Alexei briefed the team one final time:

"The command post has twenty-four guards. Rotating shifts every six hours. The Judge says the next shift change is at 0200—that's our window. Team Alpha takes the north entrance, neutralizes guards, secures the detention area. Team Bravo plants explosives in the communications room. I'll handle the command center. We're in and out in twelve minutes. Questions?"

A young woman—Anya, former teacher, twenty-three years old—asked: "What if civilians are in the command center?"

"Then we get them out. No one dies who doesn't have to."

"And if we're compromised?"

"Then we improvise. Stick to the plan until you can't, then do whatever keeps you alive."

It wasn't a comforting answer. But it was honest.

---

The operation launched at 0200. Team Alpha moved on the north entrance. Alexei watched through night vision: they neutralized two guards silently, efficiently.

Good. They were learning.

Team Bravo entered through a side window. Alexei followed, moving through the darkened building like a ghost. He'd done this hundreds of times. It had become automatic.

He reached the command center. Two officers inside, reviewing tactical displays. Alexei could kill them silently. But he didn't. He knocked them unconscious instead.

They were soldiers, but they weren't his enemy. SFW leadership was his enemy. These men were just following orders.

He planted data extraction devices on the computers—designed by Kira and Nikolai, they'd copy all SFW intelligence and transmit it to The Judge. Then he planted explosives. Timed detonation: fifteen minutes.

Team Alpha reported: "Detention area secured. Forty-three civilians, mostly families. Some wounded. Need medical attention."

Team Bravo: "Explosives planted in communications room. Ready for extraction."

Alexei: "Begin extraction. Move civilians first. We cover."

---

The civilians emerged from the basement—families, children, elderly. They were terrified, malnourished, some injured. They'd been detained for weeks, interrogated about resistance activities, used as leverage against fighters.

Alexei saw a child—maybe six years old—clinging to her mother. The child was crying. The mother looked at Alexei with desperate hope:

"You're here to save us?"

"Yes. Stay quiet. Stay close. We'll get you out."

They began moving civilians through the extraction route. It was slow—the civilians couldn't move fast, some needed to be carried. The twelve-minute timeline was already blown. They were at fifteen minutes. Then eighteen.

Team Bravo's leader—a man named Pavel, former engineer—radios: "Movement outside. SFW patrol returning early. We're compromised."

Alexei made a decision: "Get the civilians out. I'll hold the patrol."

Pavel: "You can't hold them alone."

"I can hold them long enough. Move. Now."

The team evacuated with the civilians. Alexei positioned himself at a chokepoint—a narrow corridor with good cover. The SFW patrol entered the building: eight soldiers, heavily armed.

Alexei opened fire. Dropped two immediately. The others took cover, returned fire. Bullets tore through the walls. Alexei moved, repositioned, fired again. Dropped another.

The patrol called for reinforcements. Alexei heard sirens in the distance. He needed to hold for five more minutes. Give the team time to escape.

He held for three minutes. Then four. Then five.

The explosives detonated. The command center erupted in flames. The communications room collapsed. The building shook.

Alexei used the chaos to escape. He ran through smoke and fire, SFW soldiers pursuing. He was hit—bullet grazed his shoulder, painful but not critical. He kept running.

---

He reached the extraction point. The team was gone—good, they'd made it out with the civilians. But SFW forces were closing in. He was surrounded.

He thought about his siblings: Dmitri on the front lines, leading soldiers into battle. Nikolai in the capital, protecting The Judge. Elena, his sister, organizing resistance across occupied territory.

The Volkov family at war.

He thought: *We're all going to die in this war. The only question is: for what?*

For him, the answer was clear: for these forty-three civilians. For the families he just saved. For the children who'd grow up free because he fought.

That was worth dying for.

But he wasn't ready to die yet.

He fought his way through the encirclement. Used every trick he knew: smoke grenades, flashbangs, misdirection. He was wounded, exhausted, running on adrenaline and desperation.

But he was alive.

He escaped into the city, disappeared into shadows. SFW searched for hours. But Alexei was a ghost. And ghosts don't get caught.

---

Three days later, Alexei made contact with Elena's resistance network. They extracted him from occupied territory, brought him to a safe house.

Elena was there, waiting.

"You're an idiot," she said. "Holding off eight soldiers alone. You could have died."

"But I didn't."

"This time. What about next time?"

"I'll improvise."

Elena hugged him. "You're my brother. I need you alive. Stop taking stupid risks."

"I'll stop when the war ends."

"That might be never."

"Then I'll never stop."

Elena pulled back, looked at him seriously. "Alexei, you're burning out. I can see it. You're pushing too hard. You need rest."

"I'll rest when we win."

"And if we don't win?"

"Then I'll rest when I'm dead."

Elena sighed. She knew her brother. Stubborn. Relentless. Unable to quit.

Just like all the Volkovs.

Alexei reported to General Sokolov via secure channel:

**MISSION SUCCESSFUL. COMMAND POST DESTROYED. FORTY-THREE CIVILIANS RESCUED. SFW INTELLIGENCE COPIED. MINOR INJURIES.**

Sokolov's response: **EXCELLENT WORK. BUT ELENA IS RIGHT—YOU'RE PUSHING TOO HARD. TAKE THREE DAYS REST. THAT'S AN ORDER.**

**CAN'T. TOO MANY TARGETS.**

**ALEXEI, YOU'RE NO GOOD TO US DEAD. REST. RECOVER. THEN RETURN TO OPERATIONS.**

Alexei wanted to argue. But he was exhausted. His shoulder hurt. His body was breaking down.

He typed: **UNDERSTOOD. THREE DAYS.**

---

Alexei spent three days in the safe house, recovering. It was the first rest he'd had in weeks. He slept for sixteen hours straight. Woke up, ate, slept again.

On the second day, he talked with Elena.

"Do you ever wonder if it's worth it?" Elena asked. "All this fighting, all this sacrifice?"

"Every day."

"And?"

"I don't have an answer. But I keep fighting anyway."

"Why?"

"Because someone has to. Because those forty-three civilians deserved rescue. Because if we don't fight, who will?"

Elena nodded. "Same reason I fight. Same reason we all fight. Not because we know it's worth it. Because we can't live with ourselves if we don't."

They sat in silence for a while.

Then Elena asked: "What will you do when the war ends? If it ends?"

"I don't know. I've been fighting so long, I don't remember how to do anything else."

"Maybe we'll learn together. All of us. The Volkov family, learning to live in peace."

"That sounds nice."

"It does. But I don't think it'll happen. I think we'll die in this war. All of us."

"Probably. But maybe that's okay. Maybe dying for something is better than living for nothing."

Elena looked at him. "You really believe that?"

"I don't know. Ask me when I'm dying. Maybe then I'll have an answer."

---

On the third day, Alexei received new orders from Sokolov:

**PRIORITY TARGET: SFW INTELLIGENCE CENTER. GENERAL STONE'S HEADQUARTERS. HIGHEST VALUE. HIGHEST RISK. PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS: 31%. PROBABILITY OF SURVIVAL: 45%. RECOMMEND ABORT.**

Alexei studied the intelligence. General Marcus Stone—SFW's supreme commander. The brain behind the invasion. The strategist coordinating everything.

Killing him would decapitate SFW's command structure. Throw them into chaos. Maybe end the war.

But it was a suicide mission. Thirty-one percent success. Forty-five percent survival.

Alexei typed: **PROCEEDING.**

Sokolov responded: **ALEXEI, THIS IS TOO DANGEROUS. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE YOU.**

**YOU CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO TRY. IF I SUCCEED, THE WAR ENDS. IF I FAIL, YOU FIND SOMEONE ELSE.**

**THERE IS NO ONE ELSE. YOU'RE THE BEST WE HAVE.**

**THEN I WON'T FAIL.**

Long pause. Then:

**GOOD LUCK, ALEXEI VOLKOV. VERIDICA IS GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SERVICE.**

Alexei closed the channel. Began planning the operation.

The most dangerous mission of his life.

Maybe the last mission of his life.

But if it ended the war, it was worth it.

---

Alexei thought about his life. Forty-two years old. Never married. No children. No legacy except the operations he'd conducted, the targets he'd destroyed, the people he'd saved.

Was that enough? Was that a life worth living?

He didn't know. But it was the life he'd chosen. The life he'd built. The life he'd dedicated to serving his nation.

He thought of an old poem—"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night" by Dylan Thomas. *Rage, rage against the dying of the light.*

He would rage. He would fight. He would refuse to quit.

Even if it killed him.

Especially if it killed him.

Because dying for something was better than living for nothing.

He believed that. He had to believe that.

Otherwise, everything he'd done was meaningless.

---

Alexei prepared for the mission. Studied intelligence. Planned routes. Identified vulnerabilities. The Judge provided perfect information, but information wasn't enough.

You needed skill. Patience. Nerve. Luck.

He had the first three. The fourth... he'd find out.

He thought about his siblings one more time. Sent them encrypted messages:

**TO DMITRI: YOU'RE THE BEST SOLDIER I KNOW. KEEP FIGHTING.**

**TO ELENA: YOU'RE THE BEST LEADER I KNOW. KEEP ORGANIZING.**

**TO NIKOLAI: YOU'RE THE BEST TECHNICIAN I KNOW. KEEP INNOVATING.**

**TO ALL: IF I DON'T COME BACK, KNOW THAT I DIED DOING WHAT I BELIEVED IN. THAT'S ENOUGH.**

He sent the messages. Then he deleted them from his system. No evidence. No trail.

Just a ghost, preparing for one last operation.

---

Alexei left the safe house at midnight. Moved through occupied territory toward SFW headquarters. It would take three days to reach. Three days of moving through enemy lines, avoiding patrols, staying invisible.

He'd done it before. He'd do it again.

One last time.

He thought: *Someone has to try. Might as well be me.*

And he disappeared into the darkness.

A ghost, hunting the enemy's heart.

*End of Chapter 11*
