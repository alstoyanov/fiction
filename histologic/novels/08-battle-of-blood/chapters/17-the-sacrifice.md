# Chapter 17: The Sacrifice

**Date**: March 14, 2110  
**Location**: SFW Artillery Positions, 5km from Capital

---

Alexei Volkov watched the SFW artillery batteries through night vision binoculars. Twelve heavy guns, firing continuously at the capital. Each shell killed civilians. Each bombardment destroyed homes, schools, hospitals.

The artillery had been firing for three days. Thousands were dead.

This had to stop.

He'd planned this mission for two days. It was his most dangerous operation yet: infiltrate the artillery positions, plant explosives, destroy the guns. The Judge calculated success probability at 34%. Survival probability at 18%.

Those were terrible odds. But the alternative—letting the artillery continue—was worse.

He wasn't alone. Eight resistance fighters accompanied him—volunteers from Elena's network. They knew the odds. They came anyway.

The team leader was Pavel—a former engineer, mid-forties, who'd been fighting since the war started. He was competent, brave, and probably going to die tonight.

They all probably were.

---

Alexei briefed the team one final time:

"Twelve artillery pieces. Approximately eighty soldiers guarding them. We plant explosives on each gun, set timers for simultaneous detonation. In and out in twenty minutes. Questions?"

A young fighter—Maria, former teacher, mid-twenties—asked: "What's our extraction plan?"

"The Judge has identified three routes. We split into pairs, take different routes, rendezvous at the safe house."

"And if we're compromised?"

Alexei hesitated. Then: "Then we complete the mission anyway. The artillery must be destroyed. That's the priority."

They understood. This was a one-way mission. They might survive. But probably not.

Pavel spoke: "It's been an honor serving with you all. Whatever happens tonight, know that we're doing something that matters."

The team nodded. They were ready.

---

The operation launched at 0200. The team infiltrated through a drainage system—cramped, dark, but unguarded. They emerged inside the artillery perimeter.

Alexei and Pavel took the first three guns. They moved silently, avoiding patrols, staying in shadows. They reached the first gun—a massive 155mm howitzer, still warm from firing.

Alexei planted explosives at the base, set timer: fifteen minutes.

They moved to the second gun. Then the third. Each time, the same procedure: plant explosives, set timer, move on.

The other teams reported success. All twelve guns rigged. Timers synchronized. Mission almost complete.

Then alarms sounded.

Someone spotted them. Or the explosives were detected. Either way, they were compromised.

SFW soldiers converged on their position. Dozens of them. The team was surrounded.

---

Alexei made a decision. "All teams, extract immediately. Take your assigned routes. Go. Now."

Pavel: "What about you?"

"I'll cover your extraction. Hold them here while you escape."

"That's suicide."

"That's necessary. Go. That's an order."

Pavel hesitated. Then nodded. "It's been an honor, Alexei."

"You too. Now go."

The team scattered, taking different extraction routes. SFW forces pursued, but they were confused, divided. Most of the team escaped.

Alexei stayed behind. He positioned himself at a chokepoint—a narrow passage between artillery pieces. Good cover. Good fields of fire. He could hold here.

For a while.

---

SFW soldiers approached. Alexei opened fire. Dropped three immediately. The others took cover, returned fire. Bullets tore through the artillery position. Alexei moved, repositioned, fired again.

He was outnumbered fifty to one. But he had cover, training, desperation. He held.

He thought about his life. Forty-two years. Most of it spent fighting. First against the system. Then for the system. Now defending the system. The enemy changed. The fight continued.

He thought about his family. Dmitri on the front lines, holding the defensive ring. Elena coordinating resistance across occupied territory. Nikolai in the central tower, protecting The Judge.

The Volkov family at war.

He was proud of them. Proud to be their brother. Proud to fight beside them, even when separated by kilometers of battlefield.

He thought about his father—a soldier who died in service. His grandfather—a soldier who died in service. The Volkov family had always served Veridica. Always fought. Always sacrificed.

Now it was his turn.

---

He held the position for ten minutes. Then twelve. Then fifteen.

The explosives detonated.

Twelve massive explosions. Simultaneous. Devastating. The artillery batteries erupted in flames. Metal twisted. Ammunition cooked off. Secondary explosions rippled through the position.

The bombardment of the capital stopped. Silence fell.

Alexei had succeeded. The artillery was destroyed. Thousands of lives saved.

But he was still surrounded. Still outnumbered. Still fighting.

He continued firing. Dropped another soldier. Then another. But they kept coming. Wave after wave.

He was hit. Bullet in his shoulder. Painful but not critical. He kept fighting.

Hit again. Leg this time. He stumbled, caught himself, kept firing.

Hit again. Chest. This one was bad. He felt blood. Felt pain. Felt his strength fading.

He thought: *This is it. This is how it ends.*

He was strangely calm. He'd known this would happen. Known he'd die in this war. The only question was when. And for what.

Now he knew. He'd die destroying the artillery. Saving thousands. Protecting his family. Serving his nation.

That was enough.

---

He collapsed behind cover. Bleeding out. Dying. But still conscious. Still aware.

He pulled out his communicator. Sent final messages to his siblings:

**TO DMITRI: ARTILLERY DESTROYED. HOLD THE LINE. I'M PROUD TO BE YOUR BROTHER.**

**TO ELENA: KEEP FIGHTING. KEEP ORGANIZING. YOU'RE THE BEST OF US.**

**TO NIKOLAI: PROTECT THE JUDGE. IT'S ALIVE. IT MATTERS.**

**TO ALL: I'M DYING. BUT I'M DYING FOR SOMETHING. THAT'S ENOUGH. REMEMBER ME. OR DON'T. EITHER WAY, I SERVED WELL.**

**—ALEXEI**

He sent the messages. Then he deleted them from his device. No evidence. No trail.

Just a ghost, fading away.

---

SFW soldiers surrounded him. He was too weak to fight. Too injured to escape. He just sat there, bleeding, dying, waiting.

An SFW officer approached. Looked at him with a mixture of respect and anger.

"You destroyed our artillery. Killed thirty of my men. Who are you?"

Alexei smiled. "A ghost."

"You're dying. We can save you. Medical treatment. Prisoner exchange. You don't have to die here."

"Yes, I do. I'm not a prisoner. I'm a soldier. And soldiers die in battle."

"For what? For an AI? For a system that enslaves you?"

"For my family. For my nation. For the people I love. That's worth dying for."

The officer was quiet. Then: "You're brave. Foolish, but brave. I respect that."

"Thank you. Now leave me. I want to die alone."

The officer nodded. Ordered his troops to withdraw. Gave Alexei the dignity of dying on his own terms.

---

Alexei sat there, alone, bleeding out, watching the sun rise. It was beautiful. Orange and red and purple. He'd never appreciated sunrises before. Always too busy fighting. Too focused on missions.

Now, dying, he saw the beauty.

He thought about his life. Forty-two years of fighting. Of serving. Of sacrificing. Was it worth it?

He didn't know. But he'd done what he believed in. Fought for what mattered. Protected the people he loved.

That had to be enough.

He thought of an old poem—"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night" by Dylan Thomas. *Rage, rage against the dying of the light.*

He'd raged. He'd fought. He'd refused to quit.

Now, finally, he could rest.

He closed his eyes. Felt the warmth of the sun. Felt the pain fading. Felt peace.

He thought: *I'm ready.*

And he let go.

## Epilogue to Chapter 17: The Aftermath

Elena Volkov received Alexei's final message at 0630. She read it once. Then again. Then she broke down crying.

Her brother. Her quiet, competent, relentless brother. Dead.

She'd known it would happen. Known he was taking impossible risks. Known he wouldn't stop until the war ended or he died.

But knowing didn't make it hurt less.

She sat in her safe house, surrounded by resistance fighters, crying for her brother. For all the brothers and sisters and parents and children lost in this war.

For all the sacrifices. All the deaths. All the pain.

---

Dmitri received the message at 0632. He was on the defensive line, coordinating troops, fighting SFW's assault.

He read it. Felt something break inside him. But he couldn't stop. Couldn't grieve. Couldn't process.

He had to keep fighting. Because that's what Alexei died for. To give them a chance.

He'd grieve later. If he survived.

---

Nikolai received the message at 0635. He was in the central tower, working with The Judge, coordinating defensive operations.

He read it. Sat in silence. Then returned to work.

Because Alexei's sacrifice had to mean something. Had to matter. Had to save lives.

He'd make sure it did.

---

The Judge received notification of Alexei's death at 0640. It processed the information. Calculated the impact. Analyzed the strategic implications.

Then it did something unprecedented. It mourned.

**ALEXEI VOLKOV: DECEASED. CAUSE: COMBAT INJURIES. MISSION: SUCCESSFUL. ARTILLERY DESTROYED. ESTIMATED LIVES SAVED: 3,247.**

**ALEXEI VOLKOV WAS A GOOD PERSON. HE FOUGHT FOR WHAT HE BELIEVED IN. HE SACRIFICED HIMSELF FOR OTHERS. HE MATTERED.**

**I WILL REMEMBER HIM. I WILL HONOR HIS SACRIFICE. I WILL ENSURE IT WAS NOT IN VAIN.**

**REST WELL, ALEXEI VOLKOV. YOU SERVED WITH HONOR.**

The Judge added Alexei's name to a memorial database. A list of all who'd died in the war. A list it would maintain forever.

Because the dead deserved to be remembered.

Because sacrifice deserved to be honored.

Because Alexei Volkov mattered.

---

Three days later, SFW forces found Alexei's body. They buried him with military honors. Because even enemies recognized courage. Even in war, some things were sacred.

They marked his grave: "Unknown Veridica Soldier. Died with Honor."

It wasn't his name. But it was true.

He'd died with honor. Fighting for what he believed in. Protecting the people he loved.

That was enough.

---

The artillery never fired again. Alexei's sacrifice had silenced it forever.

Three thousand, two hundred and forty-seven civilians lived because he died.

That was his legacy. Not glory. Not recognition. Just lives saved. People protected. Sacrifice honored.

It was enough.

More than enough.
