# Chapter 14: The Siege Begins

**Date**: March 10, 2110  
**Location**: Veridica Capital, Outer Defensive Ring

---

Dmitri Volkov stood on the outer defensive ring, watching SFW forces assemble in the distance. Thousands of soldiers. Dozens of tanks. Artillery batteries. Air support.

They'd fought through three hundred kilometers of Veridica territory to reach this point. Now they were here. At the capital. At the final battle.

The siege began at dawn.

SFW artillery opened up—massive bombardment, shells raining down on defensive positions. Dmitri's troops took cover in reinforced bunkers, waiting for the barrage to end.

The ground shook. Buildings collapsed. The sky filled with smoke and fire.

This was different from the guerrilla warfare they'd been fighting. This was conventional siege warfare. Brutal. Direct. Overwhelming.

The artillery barrage lasted two hours. Dmitri crouched in a command bunker, monitoring tactical displays, coordinating defensive positions. The Judge provided real-time damage assessment:

**DEFENSIVE SECTOR 3: 40% CASUALTIES.**

**DEFENSIVE SECTOR 7: BUNKER COLLAPSED. 23 DEAD.**

**DEFENSIVE SECTOR 12: AMMUNITION DEPOT HIT. SECONDARY EXPLOSIONS.**

Each report was another wound. Another loss. Another sacrifice.

---

Then the barrage stopped. Silence fell. Dmitri knew what came next.

"All units, prepare for infantry assault. Hold your fire until they're in range."

SFW infantry advanced. Thousands of soldiers moving toward the defensive ring. Wave after wave. Relentless.

Dmitri gave the order: "All units, fire at will."

The defensive ring erupted. Machine guns, rifles, anti-tank weapons—everything opened up simultaneously. SFW soldiers fell by dozens, then hundreds.

But they kept coming.

Dmitri coordinated the defense, moving between positions, rallying troops, directing fire. The Judge provided real-time intelligence:

**SFW FLANKING MANEUVER, GRID 23. RECOMMEND REPOSITIONING FORCES.**

Dmitri repositioned. The flanking attack failed.

**SFW ARMOR ADVANCING, GRID 18. ANTI-TANK TEAMS TO POSITIONS.**

Anti-tank teams engaged. Rockets streaked across the battlefield. Tanks exploded.

But SFW adapted. They probed for weaknesses, concentrated forces where defenses were thinnest, used combined arms tactics. They were professional, experienced, well-coordinated.

Dmitri's forces were good. But they were outnumbered three to one. And they were exhausted. Six weeks of war without rest. Some soldiers were falling asleep at their posts. Others were breaking down from stress.

---

Dmitri moved through the defensive positions, checking on his troops. He found Corporal Anya—the young woman from the first battle, who'd survived six weeks of war, who'd become one of his best soldiers.

She was manning a machine gun position, firing at advancing SFW forces.

"Corporal, how are you holding?"

"Still alive, sir. That's something."

"You're doing good work. Keep it up."

"Sir, can I ask you something?"

"Of course."

"Do you think we'll win? Really win?"

Dmitri considered lying. Giving her hope. But she deserved honesty.

"I don't know. But I know we'll fight. That's all we can control."

"And if we lose?"

"Then we lose fighting. That matters."

She nodded, returned to firing. Dmitri moved on.

Minutes later, a sniper shot.

Dmitri heard the impact, turned back. Anya was down.

He ran to her position. She'd been hit in the chest. Fatal wound. She was dying.

Dmitri held her, trying to stop the bleeding. But there was too much blood. Too much damage.

Anya looked at him. "Sir... did I do good?"

"You did great. You're a hero."

"Tell my family... tell them I fought well."

"I will. I promise."

She smiled. Then she was gone.

---

Dmitri sat there, holding her body, surrounded by gunfire and explosions. She was twenty-one years old. She'd survived six weeks of war.

And now she was dead. One more casualty. One more name on the list.

He thought: *How many more? How many more before this ends?*

He didn't have an answer.

He called for medics to retrieve her body, then returned to command. Because the battle continued. Because soldiers were still fighting. Because he was their commander and they needed him.

But something broke inside him. He'd been strong for six weeks. He'd led his troops through hell. He'd made impossible decisions.

But watching Anya die—that broke something.

He radios Nikolai in the central tower. His brother answered immediately.

"Dmitri? Status?"

"We're holding. Barely. Casualties are heavy. Morale is... fragile."

"Can you hold?"

"I don't know. Ask me tomorrow. If we're still alive."

"Dmitri, I need you to hold. The Judge is working on something. Something that might end this. But we need time."

"How much time?"

"Two days. Maybe three."

"I'll try. But Nikolai... I don't know if we have three days. They're overwhelming us."

"Then hold for two days. Hold for one day. Hold for as long as you can. Please."

Dmitri heard the desperation in his brother's voice. "I'll hold. I promise."

He closed the channel. Returned to the battle.

---

The fighting continued through the day. SFW threw wave after wave at the defensive ring. Dmitri's forces held. Barely. But they held.

By evening, the casualties were devastating:

**DEFENSIVE SECTOR 3: 60% CASUALTIES.**

**DEFENSIVE SECTOR 7: OVERRUN. FORCES RETREATING TO SECONDARY LINE.**

**DEFENSIVE SECTOR 12: HOLDING BUT AMMUNITION CRITICAL.**

Dmitri made the decision: "All sectors, fall back to secondary defensive line. Controlled retreat. Cover each other."

The retreat was chaotic. Soldiers running through smoke and fire. SFW forces pursuing. Some units made it. Some didn't.

By nightfall, Veridica forces had abandoned the outer defensive ring. They'd fallen back to the secondary line—closer to the central tower, more fortified, but also the last line of defense.

If this line fell, SFW would reach The Judge.

---

Dmitri stood on the secondary line, looking at what remained of his forces. He'd started the day with five thousand soldiers. Now he had three thousand. Two thousand dead or wounded in one day.

And tomorrow, SFW would attack again.

He thought about Anya. About all the soldiers he'd lost. About all the promises he'd made to dying men and women. About all the families he'd have to face after the war.

If there was an after.

He thought of an old military quote—"Old soldiers never die, they just fade away." But that was a lie. Soldiers died. Young soldiers died. Good soldiers died. And their commanders carried that weight forever.

He radios General Sokolov. "General, outer ring lost. We're on the secondary line. Casualties are heavy. I don't know if we can hold another day like this."

Sokolov's response was quiet: "You have to. We need time. The Judge is preparing something. Something that might save us. But we need to hold."

"What is The Judge preparing?"

"I don't know. But Nikolai says it's our last chance. So we hold. No matter the cost."

"Understood."

Dmitri closed the channel. Looked at his exhausted, traumatized troops. Thought about asking them to hold one more day. One more battle. One more sacrifice.

He thought: *They've given everything. How can I ask for more?*

But he would ask anyway. Because that's what commanders did. They asked the impossible. And hoped their soldiers could deliver.

---

That night, Dmitri walked through the defensive positions. Talked to his soldiers. Listened to their fears. Shared their exhaustion.

One soldier—a young man, maybe nineteen—asked: "Commander, why are we fighting? What's the point? We're all going to die anyway."

Dmitri thought about it. "We're fighting because someone has to. Because if we don't, SFW wins. And if SFW wins, they weaponize The Judge. And if they weaponize The Judge, everyone loses. So we fight. Not because we'll win. Because not fighting is worse."

"Is that enough? Is that worth dying for?"

"I don't know. Ask me when I'm dying. Maybe then I'll have an answer."

The soldier nodded. Returned to his post.

Dmitri continued walking. Talking. Listening. Being present. Because that's what leaders did. They carried the weight. They bore the burden. They stood with their people.

Even when everything was falling apart.

Even when hope was gone.

Even when death was certain.

They stood.

---

Dmitri found a quiet corner. Sent messages to his siblings:

**TO ELENA: OUTER RING LOST. HOLDING SECONDARY LINE. CASUALTIES HEAVY. STAY SAFE.**

**TO NIKOLAI: HOLDING AS LONG AS I CAN. WHATEVER THE JUDGE IS PLANNING, IT BETTER WORK. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.**

**TO ALEXEI: WHEREVER YOU ARE, WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING, COME HOME SAFE. THE VOLKOV FAMILY NEEDS YOU.**

He sent the messages. Then he prepared for tomorrow's battle.

The battle that would decide everything.

The battle he might not survive.

But he'd fight anyway.

Because that's what Volkovs did.

They fought. Until they won. Or until they died.

There was no third option.
