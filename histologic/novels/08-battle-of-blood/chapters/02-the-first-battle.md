# Chapter 2: The First Battle

**Date**: February 2, 2110  
**Location**: Border defensive position, twenty kilometers inside Veridica

---

Dmitri Volkov stood in his defensive position at dawn, watching the horizon through tactical binoculars. His forces: two hundred soldiers spread across a kilometer of fortified line. Trenches. Barriers. Improvised fortifications built in six months of frantic preparation.

It wasn't enough. It would never be enough.

His soldiers were mostly young. Early twenties. Historians, technicians, administrators pressed into military service because Veridica needed bodies. Many had never fired a weapon outside training. Now they were about to face professional troops.

Dmitri thought about his brothers. Alexei somewhere behind enemy lines on sabotage missions. Nikolai safe in the capital coordinating cyber warfare. And Elena, his sister, organizing resistance networks.

The Volkov family at war.

His comm unit crackled. "Commander Volkov, this is Command. Enemy forces approaching your position. ETA: fifteen minutes. Rules of engagement: hold as long as possible, then execute fighting retreat to Position Beta."

"Understood. How long do we hold?"

"As long as you can. Every minute buys time for evacuation."

The channel closed. Dmitri looked at his troops. Saw the fear in their faces. They'd heard the reports from other positions. Seventy percent casualties. Defensive lines collapsing. Professional soldiers overwhelming amateurs.

"Listen up," Dmitri called. His troops gathered. "SFW forces will be here in minutes. They're professional. We're not. They have experience. We don't. They're going to try to break us."

He saw the fear intensifying. Good. Fear kept you alive.

"But we have something they don't. We're defending our home. Our families. Our nation. They're invading for conquest. We're fighting for survival. That matters."

It was a lie. Or at least, not entirely true. Motivation didn't stop bullets. But his troops needed something to hold onto.

"Remember your training. Follow your squad leaders. Watch your sectors. And when I give the order to retreat, you retreat. Understood?"

"Yes, sir!"

Dmitri returned to his position. Checked his weapon. Thought about all the times he'd fought—against corruption, against authoritarianism, against the system itself. Always with principles. Always believing in something.

Now he was fighting with guns. And he didn't know what he believed anymore.

---

The SFW forces appeared at 06:15. Dmitri watched through his binoculars: tanks, armored vehicles, infantry. Professional formation. Coordinated advance. Overwhelming.

Artillery came first. Shells screaming overhead. Explosions. Earth and snow flying. His soldiers dove for cover, some screaming, some freezing in terror.

"Stay down!" Dmitri shouted. "Wait for infantry!"

The artillery barrage lasted ten minutes. When it stopped, Dmitri's ears were ringing. He checked his troops: three dead, seven wounded. And the battle hadn't even started.

Then the tanks came. Rolling forward. Machine guns chattering. Armor impervious to their light weapons.

"RPG teams!" Dmitri ordered. "Target the tanks!"

Two soldiers with rocket-propelled grenades stood, aimed, fired. One rocket missed. The other hit—explosion, smoke, but the tank kept rolling. Modern armor. Their weapons were obsolete.

The tank returned fire. One RPG soldier fell, torn apart by machine gun fire.

Then the infantry advanced. Professional troops moving under covering fire. Coordinated. Experienced. Overwhelming.

"Fire!" Dmitri ordered.

His troops opened up. Rifles cracking. Some soldiers shooting wildly, desperately. Others more controlled, remembering training.

SFW soldiers fell. But most kept advancing. For every one that fell, ten kept coming.

A young soldier next to Dmitri—barely twenty, named Pavel—took a round to the chest. Dmitri grabbed him, tried to apply pressure to the wound. But the round had hit lung. Pavel coughed blood, eyes wide with terror.

"Commander—I can't—I can't breathe—"

"Medic!" Dmitri shouted. But there was no medic close enough. Pavel died in seconds, blood on snow, eyes still open.

First death Dmitri had witnessed up close. Not the last.

---

The defensive line broke in twenty minutes.

SFW forces punched through on the left flank. Dmitri's troops there—mostly young, mostly terrified—broke and ran. He tried to rally them, but panic was contagious.

"Fall back!" Dmitri ordered. "Organized retreat! Squad leaders, maintain formation!"

But it wasn't organized. It was a rout. Soldiers running, dropping weapons, abandoning positions. Professional troops pursuing, cutting them down.

Dmitri covered the retreat, firing until his weapon overheated. Saw his soldiers falling. Saw the line collapsing. Saw everything he'd tried to build disintegrating.

He thought: *We've fought with facts for so long, we forgot how to fight with blood. Now we're paying the price.*

They fell back to Position Beta—a secondary defensive line two kilometers back. Of his two hundred soldiers, one hundred thirty remained. Seventy dead or wounded in thirty minutes.

Dmitri radioed command: "Position Alpha lost. Heavy casualties. Falling back to Position Beta."

General Sokolov's voice, steady despite the chaos: "Understood. All positions report similar. We're implementing new strategy. Hold Position Beta as long as you can."

"How long?"

"Until you can't."

The channel closed. Dmitri looked at his surviving troops. They were traumatized, exhausted, broken. Some were crying. Some were staring at nothing. Some were tending to wounded.

This was war. This was what they'd been unprepared for.

---

That evening, after SFW forces had stopped their advance to consolidate, Dmitri sat with his surviving troops in the ruins of Position Beta. They'd held for three more hours, then fallen back again. Now they were at Position Gamma—the third defensive line.

One hundred thirty soldiers had become ninety. Forty more casualties in the afternoon fighting.

A young woman—Corporal Anya, maybe twenty-two—approached Dmitri. "Commander, can we win this?"

Dmitri wanted to lie. Wanted to give her hope. But he'd never been good at lying.

"I don't know."

"Then why are we fighting?"

"Because we can. Because our people need time to evacuate. Because every hour we hold is an hour they survive."

"That's not very inspiring, sir."

"No. It's not. But it's honest."

Anya sat beside him. "I joined the military for education benefits. To serve my nation. I never thought—" She gestured at the battlefield. "I never thought this."

"None of us did."

"Pavel was my friend. From training. We were going to—" Her voice broke. "He died so fast. One second he was there, next second he was gone."

Dmitri didn't have words. What could he say? That it would be okay? That Pavel's death meant something? Both would be lies.

"I'm sorry," Dmitri said. "I'm sorry I couldn't protect him. I'm sorry I can't protect any of you. I'm sorry we're in this situation."

"It's not your fault, sir."

"Isn't it? I'm your commander. Your survival is my responsibility."

"You're doing your best."

"My best isn't good enough."

They sat in silence. Around them, other soldiers tended to wounds, cleaned weapons, tried to rest. Young people who'd woken up yesterday thinking about classes, about jobs, about normal life.

Now thinking about survival.

---

Dmitri thought about his brothers. About Alexei, who always believed in fighting for what's right. About Elena, who taught him that resistance is survival. About Nikolai, who showed him that intelligence matters as much as strength.

He thought about the resistance, about the years of fighting corruption, about believing in principles.

Now he was fighting with guns. And principles seemed very far away.

He gathered his troops. Ninety soldiers, exhausted and traumatized, looking to him for guidance.

"Listen," Dmitri said. "We lost today. We'll probably lose tomorrow. But every day we fight, we buy time. Time for our people to evacuate. Time for our strategists to plan. Time for our resistance to organize."

"We're not here to win battles. We're here to not lose the war. We're here to survive. To make SFW pay for every kilometer. To slow them down. To give our nation a chance."

"That's not heroic. That's not inspiring. But it's real. And sometimes real is all we have."

The troops looked at him. Some nodded. Some just stared. But they stayed. They didn't run.

That was something.

---

That night, Dmitri stood watch, looking toward enemy lines. He could see their fires, hear their voices. Professional soldiers, confident, victorious.

And here he was: a resistance fighter turned soldier, leading amateurs against professionals. Fighting a war he didn't know how to win.

He thought of an old song Mikhail used to sing at resistance meetings: "We Shall Overcome." The anthem of hope. The promise that justice would prevail.

Dmitri didn't believe it. Not anymore. They wouldn't overcome. They'd just survive. Maybe.

But he'd fight anyway. Because what else was there?

His comm unit chimed. Message from Elena: *Heard about Alpha position. You okay?*

Dmitri typed back: *Alive. Lost seventy. Not okay.*

*I'm sorry. Alexei's behind their lines. Nikolai's in capital. We're all fighting.*

*I know. Stay safe.*

*You too, brother.*

The channel closed. Dmitri looked at the stars. Clear night. Cold. Beautiful.

Somewhere out there, his brothers were fighting. His sister was organizing. His nation was being invaded.

And he was standing in a trench, commanding ninety terrified soldiers, trying to slow down an army.

He thought: *This is what war is. Not glory. Not honor. Just survival. Just buying time. Just hoping tomorrow you're still alive.*

He didn't know if they'd win. Didn't know if survival was possible. Didn't know if any of this mattered.

But he'd fight anyway.

Because he was a Volkov. And Volkovs didn't quit.

Even when quitting made sense.

Even when fighting seemed hopeless.

Even when everything was falling apart.

They fought.

Because that's what they did.
