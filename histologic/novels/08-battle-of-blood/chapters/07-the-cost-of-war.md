# Chapter 7: The Cost of War

**Date**: February 15, 2110  
**Location**: Veridica, Field Hospital

Dr. Sarah Chen stood in a field hospital, surrounded by wounded soldiers. The smell of blood and antiseptic filled the air. The sounds of pain echoed through the tent. This was war, stripped of glory and propaganda.

This was what war actually looked like.

She was thirty-eight years old, a trauma surgeon who'd volunteered for military service when the war started. She'd thought she was prepared. She'd worked in emergency rooms, seen gunshot wounds, treated accident victims.

But nothing had prepared her for this.

The wounded arrived in waves. Some were treatable—broken bones, shrapnel wounds, burns. Some were dying—massive trauma, internal bleeding, catastrophic injuries. Some were already dead, but no one had time to move them yet.

She worked for eighteen hours straight. Surgery after surgery. Save this one. Lose that one. Save this one. Lose that one.

It became mechanical, automatic. She stopped seeing people and started seeing problems to solve.

A young soldier—maybe twenty years old—with his leg blown off. She amputated, cauterized, stabilized. He'd live. But he'd never walk normally again.

An older soldier—maybe forty—with shrapnel in his chest. She operated, removed the fragments, repaired the damage. But his lung was destroyed. He'd breathe, but he'd never run again.

A woman soldier—maybe twenty-five—with burns covering sixty percent of her body. Sarah did what she could, but it wasn't enough. The woman died on the operating table.

Sarah moved to the next patient.

This was the cost of war. Not the strategic cost, not the political cost. The human cost. The blood cost.

Between surgeries, Sarah talked with other medical staff. They were exhausted, traumatized, barely holding together. One nurse—a young man named Pavel—broke down crying.

"I can't do this anymore. I can't watch them die."

Sarah gripped his shoulder. "You can. Because if you don't, more will die. We're all they have."

"But it doesn't stop. They keep coming. More and more and more."

"I know. But we keep working. That's all we can do."

It wasn't comforting. But it was true.

Sarah thought about her life before the war. She'd been a successful surgeon in the capital. Good salary, comfortable apartment, respected career. She could have stayed there, treated civilian casualties, avoided the front lines.

But she'd volunteered. Because someone had to. Because these soldiers needed help. Because she couldn't live with herself if she stayed safe while others suffered.

Now she questioned that choice. Not because she regretted helping—but because she wasn't sure she was strong enough for this.

---

A soldier arrived—Dmitri Volkov. She recognized him from the news: war hero, front-line commander, brother of the president. He was wounded—shrapnel in his shoulder, not life-threatening but painful.

She treated him personally. Removed the shrapnel, cleaned the wound, bandaged it. He was stoic, barely reacting to the pain.

"You're lucky," Sarah said. "A few centimeters to the left and this would have hit your lung."

"Luck is relative in war."

"You should take leave. Rest. Recover."

"Can't. My soldiers need me."

"Your soldiers need you alive. If you push too hard, you'll get yourself killed."

"Maybe. But if I don't push hard enough, they'll get killed. I'll take my chances."

Sarah understood. It was the same logic that kept her working eighteen-hour shifts. Someone has to. Might as well be us.

She asked him: "Commander, is it worth it? All this suffering, all these deaths—is it worth it?"

Dmitri thought before answering: "I don't know. Ask me when the war is over. If we win, maybe it was worth it. If we lose... then all this suffering was for nothing."

"That's not comforting."

"War isn't comforting. It's just necessary."

After Dmitri left, Sarah continued working. More wounded arrived. More surgeries. More deaths.

She thought about the philosophy of war. She'd read the old texts: Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Tolstoy. They all talked about strategy, tactics, necessity. But they didn't talk about this—the blood, the pain, the endless stream of broken bodies.

War in theory was about nations, ideologies, strategic objectives. War in practice was about young people dying in pain, far from home, for reasons they barely understood.

She wondered: do the leaders who start wars ever see this? Do they ever stand in field hospitals, watching soldiers die? Or do they just see maps, statistics, strategic positions?

She thought of an old anti-war song: "War Pigs" by Black Sabbath. *Politicians hide themselves away / They only started the war / Why should they go out to fight? / They leave that role to the poor.*

It was true. President Volkov wasn't here. General Sokolov wasn't here. They were in command centers, making strategic decisions. She was here, dealing with the consequences.

But then she thought: that's not fair. They carry different burdens. Sokolov has to decide which soldiers to send to die. Volkov has to decide whether the war is worth fighting at all. Those are terrible choices too.

Everyone in war carries weight. Just different kinds.

A young soldier—barely eighteen—was brought in with catastrophic injuries. Chest torn open by shrapnel. Bleeding out. Sarah knew immediately: he wouldn't survive.

But she tried anyway. Opened his chest, tried to repair the damage. Worked frantically, desperately. Knowing it was futile but unable to stop.

The soldier died after ten minutes. Sarah stood there, covered in his blood, staring at his body.

Pavel asked quietly: "Doctor, why did you try? You knew he wouldn't make it."

"Because he deserved the effort. Because someone has to try. Because giving up is worse than failing."

She moved to the next patient. And the next. And the next.

The work never stopped.

That evening, during a rare break, Sarah sat outside the hospital tent, watching the sunset. The sky was beautiful—orange and red and purple. It seemed wrong that the sky could be beautiful while people were dying.

Another doctor—an older woman named Dr. Petrova—sat beside her.

"First time in a war zone?" Petrova asked.

"Yes. You?"

"Third. I was in the Fracture Years conflicts. Then the border skirmishes in the 2090s. Now this."

"How do you handle it? The constant death?"

Petrova was quiet for a moment. "You don't handle it. You carry it. Every patient you lose, you carry them. They become part of you. And eventually, you're carrying so many dead that you can barely stand."

"That's... bleak."

"That's war. But here's the thing: you also carry the ones you save. Every life you preserve, every soldier you send home, every family you keep intact. You carry them too. And sometimes, on good days, they outweigh the dead."

"Do they? Outweigh them?"

"I don't know. Ask me when I'm dying. Maybe then I'll have an answer."

They sat in silence, watching the sunset, carrying their dead.

Sarah thought about the Foundation Manuscript. She'd read fragments of it—philosophical principles about truth, justice, responsibility. One fragment stuck with her:

*"The weight of truth is measured not in facts, but in consequences. Every truth has a cost. Every lie has a cost. Choose which cost you're willing to pay."*

She thought: what's the cost of this war? Thousands dead. Tens of thousands wounded. Families destroyed. Lives shattered.

And for what? To protect The Judge? To preserve Veridica's sovereignty? To prevent SFW's conquest?

Were those reasons worth this cost?

She didn't know. But she kept working anyway. Because the soldiers needed her. Because someone had to try. Because giving up was worse than failing.

Late that night, a young soldier—maybe nineteen—was brought in with a minor wound. Leg injury, easily treatable. Sarah cleaned and bandaged it.

The soldier was crying. Not from pain—from fear.

"I don't want to go back," he said. "I don't want to fight anymore. I just want to go home."

Sarah held his hand. "I know. I'm sorry."

"Why are we fighting? What's the point? People are dying for... for what? For an AI? For territory? For pride?"

"I don't know. But I know this: you're fighting for your nation. For your family. For the people you love. That matters."

"Does it? Does it really matter? Or are we just dying for nothing?"

Sarah didn't have an answer. She just held his hand until he stopped crying.

Then she sent him back to the front lines.

Because that's what war required.

---

Sarah worked through the night. More wounded. More surgeries. More deaths.

She thought about an old story—the parable of the starfish. A man walking on a beach, throwing stranded starfish back into the ocean. Someone asks: "Why bother? There are thousands of starfish. You can't save them all."

The man throws another starfish into the water. "I saved that one."

Sarah thought: I can't save them all. But I can save this one. And this one. And this one.

Maybe that's enough.

Maybe that's all anyone can do.

Save the ones you can. Mourn the ones you can't. Keep working anyway.

By dawn, Sarah had been working for twenty-four hours straight. She was exhausted, traumatized, barely functional. But the wounded kept coming.

Dr. Petrova found her. "Sarah, you need to rest. You're going to collapse."

"I can't. They need me."

"They need you alive and functional. Not dead from exhaustion. Rest. That's an order."

Sarah wanted to argue. But she was too tired. She stumbled to a cot, collapsed, fell asleep immediately.

She dreamed of blood. Of broken bodies. Of young soldiers crying. Of death.

She woke six hours later, still exhausted. But the wounded were still coming.

So she went back to work.

Because that's what doctors did.

Even when they were broken.

Even when they couldn't save everyone.

Even when the cost seemed unbearable.

They worked.

Because someone had to.

Because the alternative was worse.

Because life, even in war, was worth fighting for.
