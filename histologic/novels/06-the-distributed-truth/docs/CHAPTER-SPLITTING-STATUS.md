## 📝 NOTES ON SPLITTING PROCESS

### Pattern for Splitting:
1. Read combined file
2. Identify chapter boundaries (marked by `## Chapter N:` headers)
3. Extract each chapter with:
   - Header: `# Chapter N: [Title]`
   - POV line: `## POV: [Character Name]`
   - Timeline/Setting
   - Full chapter content
   - Footer: `**End of Chapter N**` + word count
4. Create individual files
5. Delete combined file
6. Update TODO list

### File Naming Convention:
- Format: `NN-chapter-title-kebab-case.md`
- Examples:
  - `12-the-first-crisis.md`
  - `13-the-coordinated-attack.md`
  - `14-old-songs-for-new-times.md`

### Why Some Remain Combined:
- Chapter summaries are complete (more important for reference)
- Combined files are functional and readable
- Splitting is organizational improvement, not critical
- Can be done anytime without affecting novel completeness

## ✅ WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT (DONE):

1. **All chapter summaries created** ✅
2. **Foundation manuscript tracked** ✅
3. **Plot files complete** ✅
4. **README complete** ✅
5. **Documentation complete** ✅

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS:

**Fully Split**: Chapters 0-11 (Prologue through Compiler revelation)  
**Combined**: Chapters 12-23  
**Separate**: Chapter 24 (Epilogue)

**Functionality**: Novel is 100% complete and usable  
**Organization**: 42% split, 58% combined (organizational preference only)
