# Prologue: The Fracture

## POV: Anna Reeves (Civilian)

## May 15, 2108 - Border Zone Between Veridica and Chronos

Anna Reeves had lived on Copper Street her entire life. Forty-three years in the same apartment, overlooking the same plaza, shopping at the same market. History was supposed to be certain. The Judge said so. Facts didn't change.

Except today, they did.

She stood at her window, watching the plaza. Except it wasn't the plaza anymore. Or it was. Or it wasn't. Reality flickered like a broken hologram.

One moment: **Victory Plaza**, commemorating Veridica's triumph in the 2069 Border Settlement. Bronze statue of Chancellor Markovic signing the treaty. Brass plaques listing Veridica's territorial gains.

The next moment: **Peace Square**, honoring Chronos's diplomatic victory in the same settlement. Copper statue of Premier Volkov (no relation to the resistance Volkovs) accepting Veridica's concessions. Plaques showing Chronos's expanded borders.

Back and forth. Victory and defeat. Gain and loss. Both true. Both false. Both verified by The Judge.

Anna felt her mind splitting.

"Mama?" Her daughter Lena stood beside her, fourteen years old and confused. "What's happening to the plaza?"

"I don't know, honey."

"My school history says we won the Border Settlement. But the factorepo today says we lost. Which is true?"

Anna pulled up her terminal, querying The Judge. The response made her stomach turn:

**QUERY: Border Settlement 2069 outcome**  
**RESPONSE: Conflicting data detected. Multiple verified facts. Truth uncertain. Please consult local authorities.**

Truth uncertain.

The Judge—the infallible arbiter of reality—admitted uncertainty.

"Mama, I'm scared."

"Me too, honey."

Anna looked out at the flickering plaza. At other windows where neighbors stood watching, equally confused. At the street sign that read both "Copper Street" and "Bronze Avenue" depending on which moment you looked.

Two years ago, during the Lost Hour, an hour of history had been deleted. But this was worse. This wasn't deletion. This was duplication. Contradiction. Reality at war with itself.

Her comm device buzzed. Emergency broadcast:

**CITIZENS OF BORDER ZONE 7: Due to ongoing factorepo irregularities, please remain calm. Historical discrepancies are being investigated. The Judge is working to resolve contradictions. Normal certainty will be restored shortly.**

But Anna had studied pre-Histologic history. Had read about the Fracture Years in the 2050s-2060s, when competing truths tore societies apart. When no one could agree on basic facts. When reality became tribal.

Histologic was supposed to prevent that. The Judge was supposed to provide singular truth.

But if two nations' factorepos contradicted each other, which Judge was right? Both? Neither?

She watched the plaza flicker again. Victory. Defeat. Victory. Defeat.

And she understood: Veridica and Chronos were at war. Not with armies. With facts. Each nation inserting their version of history into the other's archives. Each claiming truth. Each verified by their own Judge.

A fact war.

Her terminal buzzed with a message from her sister in central Veridica, far from the border:

**ANNA - ARE YOU OKAY? HEARING REPORTS OF HISTORICAL INSTABILITY IN BORDER ZONES. IS IT TRUE? - MAYA**

Anna typed back:

**IT'S TRUE. REALITY IS BREAKING. THE JUDGE CAN'T DECIDE WHAT'S REAL. WE'RE LIVING IN TWO HISTORIES SIMULTANEOUSLY. SEND HELP. - A**

But what help could come? You couldn't send soldiers to fight facts. You couldn't bomb contradictory histories into submission. You couldn't defend reality with weapons.

Unless...

Anna remembered something from her pre-Histologic studies. A quote from an old philosopher, before The Judge existed:

*"In war, truth is the first casualty."*

She'd always thought it meant truth was lost in war. But watching the plaza flicker, she realized it meant something else:

Truth could be a weapon. History could be ammunition. Facts could be tactical strikes.

And if that was true, then Veridica and Chronos were in a war more dangerous than any fought with blood. Because blood could be cleaned up. Bodies could be buried. Cities could be rebuilt.

But contradictory realities? Fractured truths? Competing histories?

Those wounds couldn't heal. Those casualties couldn't be counted.

"Mama, the plaza changed again."

Anna looked. This time it wasn't Victory Plaza or Peace Square.

It was **Conflict Memorial**, a new version she'd never seen. Plaques describing the Border Settlement as "ongoing dispute, unresolved, contested by both parties."

A third truth. A compromise. An admission that neither version was certain.

Her terminal updated with new guidance from The Judge:

**BORDER SETTLEMENT 2069: Historical fact in dispute. Multiple verified sources contradict. Recommend accepting uncertainty pending resolution. Default position: Conflict Memorial designation acknowledging contested status.**

The Judge was giving up. Admitting it couldn't determine truth when two verification systems contradicted each other.

Anna felt something she hadn't felt since before Histologic: doubt. Real, fundamental doubt about what was true and what wasn't.

And she understood why the old world had been so desperate for certainty. Why they'd built Histologic. Why they'd surrendered freedom for The Judge's authority.

Because this—this flickering reality, this contradictory truth, this fundamental uncertainty about basic facts—this was terrifying.

She pulled Lena close. "Whatever happens, I'm here. We'll figure this out together."

"But what is true, Mama? How do we know?"

"I don't know anymore, honey. I don't know."

Outside, the plaza flickered again. Victory. Defeat. Conflict. Victory. Defeat. Conflict.

Reality at war with itself.

History becoming weapon.

Truth dying its first death.

And in that moment, Anna understood: the age of certain history was ending. The age of contested facts was beginning.

Whether anyone was ready for it or not.

**Two Months Later**

The plaza had stopped flickering. The Judge had made a decision: **Conflict Memorial** would be the official designation. Neither Veridica's victory nor Chronos's triumph. Just acknowledgment of dispute.

But Anna knew it wouldn't last. Because if facts could be inserted, countered, and compromised, then every fact was vulnerable. Every history could be contested. Every truth could be weaponized.

She'd started keeping a journal. Physical paper. Pen and ink. Recording what she remembered before the contradictions started. Before reality fractured.

Because if The Judge couldn't be trusted to preserve truth, then humans had to. The old way. The pre-Histologic way.

Distributed memory. Personal testimony. Collective corroboration.

The methods Histologic had promised to replace were becoming necessary again.

Not because they were better. Because centralized certainty had become a vulnerability that both nations were exploiting.

Anna wrote in her journal:

*May 15, 2108: The day reality broke. The day The Judge admitted uncertainty. The day I learned that truth can be a weapon. And the day I started remembering the old-fashioned way.*

*If facts can be inserted and deleted and contradicted, then facts alone aren't enough. We need memory. We need witnesses. We need people willing to say "I was there. I saw. I remember."*

*Even if The Judge disagrees.*

*Especially if The Judge disagrees.*

She closed the journal and looked out at the Conflict Memorial. At the compromise that satisfied no one. At the admission that truth had become contested.

And she wondered: If Veridica and Chronos were willing to wage war with facts, what other weapons would they use?

And more terrifying: What would happen when they ran out of facts to fight with?

Would they resort to something older? Something bloodier? Something that couldn't be resolved with competing histories?

Anna didn't know.

But she kept writing. Kept remembering. Kept witnessing.

Because someone had to preserve truth when certainty failed.

Someone had to be the backup when The Judge couldn't decide.

Someone had to remember.
