# Prologue Summary: The Fracture

**POV**: Anna Reeves (Civilian)  
**Timeline**: May 15, 2108  
**Setting**: Border Zone 7, Veridica-Chronos border

## Key Events

- Anna witnesses reality flickering in Border Zone 7
- The plaza alternates between "Victory Plaza" (Veridica version) and "Peace Square" (Chronos version)
- The Judge admits uncertainty: "Conflicting data detected. Truth uncertain."
- Anna realizes Veridica and Chronos are in a fact war
- A third version appears: "Conflict Memorial" acknowledging dispute
- Anna starts keeping a physical journal because The Judge is unreliable

## Character Development

**Anna Reeves**: Introduced as ordinary civilian experiencing reality fractures. Decides to keep journal as personal record when centralized certainty fails. Sets her up as the civilian advocate for distributed truth.

**Lena** (Anna's daughter, 14): Represents next generation confused by contradictory histories taught in school vs. factorepo.

## Themes

- **Reality as Weapon**: Facts can be weaponized like armies
- **The Judge's Failure**: Centralized certainty breaks under bilateral attack
- **Distributed Memory**: Anna's journal becomes personal truth preservation
- **Civilian Cost**: Ordinary people suffering from governments' fact warfare

## Significance

- Establishes the fact war's impact on civilians
- Introduces Anna as the grassroots distributed truth pioneer
- Shows The Judge admitting uncertainty (unprecedented)
- Sets up the crisis that Marcus will address
- Demonstrates that reality fractures cause genuine psychological harm

## Connections

- References Lost Hour (2 years prior): history can be deleted
- Fact war is worse: duplication/contradiction, not deletion
- Foreshadows Fracture Years (2050s-2060s): competing truths tearing societies apart
- Anna's journal methodology will become the model for transformation

## Quote

*"But what help could come? You couldn't send soldiers to fight facts. You couldn't bomb contradictory histories into submission. You couldn't defend reality with weapons."*
