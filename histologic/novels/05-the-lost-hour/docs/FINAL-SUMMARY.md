## Story Synopsis

Three months after escaping the correction facility, Marcus, Kira, and their five allies all conduct operations during a coordinated hour (14:00-15:00, November 15, 2106). But someone murders Minister Viktor Kozlov and erases that hour from the factorepo. Now everyone who acted is a suspect. The team must prove their innocence and expose the real killer—Thomas Wei—using only human testimony and physical evidence in a society built on perfect digital certainty.
