# Chapter 7: The Immigration Problem

## POV: Isaiah Okonkwo

## November 15, 2106 - 17:00

The SFW Immigration Office occupied a brutalist concrete building that couldn't have been more different from Veridica's brass-and-copper aesthetics. Isaiah sat in a waiting room filled with nervous refugees, each clutching papers that might or might not prove their legal status.

Without the factorepo, proof became uncertain. And uncertainty, in immigration law, usually meant deportation.

"Isaiah Okonkwo?" A clerk called his name.

Isaiah followed her into an office where Agent Marcus Chen—no relation to his friend—reviewed his case file with skeptical eyes.

"Your visa is dated for tomorrow," the agent said.

"Yes. I explained—the situation in Veridica became urgent. I had to leave early."

"And you crossed at 14:30?"

"According to my stamped papers, yes."

"But according to our systems..." The agent pulled up a screen showing error messages. "We have no factorepo record of your crossing. No timestamp. No verification. The data for that hour is completely missing."

"I'm aware. The factorepo experienced a failure. But my papers—"

"Were stamped by a border guard during a period when systems were down. For all we know, you crossed illegally and convinced a confused guard to stamp papers."

Isaiah kept his voice calm. "I crossed legally. Guard Reyna Volkov processed me. Immigration Agent Thomas Chen interviewed me. Both can testify."

"Testimony isn't sufficient for immigration verification. We require factorepo confirmation."

"Which doesn't exist because someone deliberately erased that hour."

The agent's expression shifted. "You're suggesting criminal conspiracy?"

"I'm suggesting that the factorepo failure wasn't accidental. Someone erased that hour for specific purposes. My crossing happened to coincide with the erasure, but that doesn't make my crossing illegal."

"It makes your crossing unverifiable. Which, legally, is almost the same thing."

Isaiah had anticipated this. He pulled out a folder. "Agent, I respectfully submit evidence of my legal presence. First: my stamped entry papers, showing 14:35 crossing. Second: testimony from Guard Volkov and Agent Chen, both of whom I've contacted and who remember processing me. Third: my journalist credentials and letter of sponsorship from Maria Santos. Fourth: photographs of my crossing, timestamped by my personal camera."

The agent reviewed each item. "Testimony and physical evidence. You're building a case like this is a criminal trial, not an immigration hearing."

"Because without factorepo verification, that's what it is. A trial to prove I existed during an hour that technically doesn't exist."

"Mr. Okonkwo, even if I accept your evidence—which I'm not certain I can—there's another problem. Veridica has filed a formal request for your extradition. They claim you stole classified documents and fled to avoid prosecution."

"What documents?"

"They don't specify. The request itself was filed before the factorepo failure, but the details were supposed to be provided during the lost hour. Those details are now gone."

Isaiah saw the irony. "So Veridica wants me extradited for crimes they can't specify, based on evidence that doesn't exist, for actions that occurred during an hour that's been erased."

"Essentially, yes."

"And you're considering granting that request?"

The agent leaned back. "I'm not. But my superiors might. The SFW has diplomatic relations with Veridica. If they push hard enough for your extradition, we might have to comply."

"Even though they can't prove I committed any crime?"

"Even though. Politics doesn't require proof." The agent closed the folder. "Mr. Okonkwo, I'm going to be honest with you. Your case is complicated. The lost hour makes verification impossible. Veridica wants you back. And without factorepo data, I can't definitively prove you're here legally."

"But you can't definitively prove I'm not."

"Exactly. Which gives me discretion." The agent pulled up a form. "I'm granting you temporary asylum pending full review. You can stay in SFW territory for ninety days while we investigate your case and resolve the factorepo situation. If Veridica provides legitimate evidence of criminal activity, we'll reconsider. If they don't, we'll grant permanent residency."

Isaiah felt tension release. "Thank you, Agent."

"Don't thank me yet. This just delays the decision. The real question is: can you prove your innocence before Veridica proves your guilt?"

"I can prove more than that. I can prove Veridica's government is systematically corrupt."

The agent's eyebrows rose. "Those classified documents they claim you stole?"

"Aren't stolen. They're evidence of corruption that I legally obtained through journalistic investigation. And I'm going to publish them."

"That will make you a bigger target."

"It will also make me more valuable free than arrested. Once the evidence is public, silencing me becomes counterproductive. I become a martyr instead of a criminal."

The agent stood, offering his hand. "Then I suggest you publish quickly. You have ninety days. Use them well."

Isaiah left the immigration office with temporary asylum papers and ninety days to change his status from refugee to legitimate resident. He took a tram back to Maria's office, already planning his publication strategy.

His comm device buzzed. Message from Marcus, routed through encrypted channels:

**ISAIAH - ARRESTED FOR KOZLOV'S MURDER. SOKOLOV BELIEVES I'M INNOCENT BUT NEEDS EVIDENCE. ANYTHING YOU CAN PROVIDE ABOUT THE LOST HOUR HELPS. ALSO: PROTECT YOUR DOCUMENTS. THEY'RE CRUCIAL. - M**

Then another message, from Dr. Tanaka:

**ISAIAH - CHRONOS IS QUESTIONING MY DEFECTORS' LEGAL STATUS. SAME PROBLEM AS YOUR BORDER CROSSING. NO FACTOREPO RECORD. NEED TO PROVE THEY LEFT VOLUNTARILY. CAN YOU HELP? - Y**

And a third, from Alexei:

**THE TWO OPERATIVES WE EXTRACTED ARE "GHOSTS." NO RECORD THEY LEFT THEIR POSITIONS. VERIDICA CLAIMS THEY'RE MISSING, POSSIBLY KIDNAPPED. INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT BREWING. WE ALL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM: PROVING THINGS HAPPENED DURING AN HOUR THAT DOESN'T EXIST. - A**

Isaiah stared at the messages. Everyone who'd operated during the lost hour now faced verification problems. Marcus framed for murder. Dr. Tanaka accused of trafficking. Alexei's operatives considered kidnapping victims. And Isaiah himself facing deportation.

All because someone had erased one hour of history.

But that same person had made a mistake. They'd erased the records, but they hadn't erased the people. The witnesses. The participants. The humans who remembered.

And human memory, collective and corroborated, could reconstruct truth.

Isaiah began composing his article:

*"THE LOST HOUR: How Veridica Erased History and Why It Matters*

*By Isaiah Okonkwo*

*On November 15, 2106, between 14:00 and 15:00, one hour of history was deliberately erased from Veridica's factorepo. Every backup. Every archive. Every distributed copy. Gone.*

*During that hour, Minister Viktor Kozlov was murdered. During that hour, dozens of people conducted legitimate operations—border crossings, defector assistance, evidence uploads. During that hour, someone committed a crime and erased the evidence.*

*But here's what they forgot: you can erase records, but you can't erase people. You can delete data, but you can't delete memory. You can remove facts from a database, but you can't remove truth from those who lived it.*

*This is the story of that hour. Told by the people who lived through it. Reconstructed from memory, testimony, and physical evidence. Proving that history exists in us, not just in our machines.*

*Because the hour may be lost, but the truth endures..."*

He wrote for three hours, documenting everything he knew about the lost hour. His crossing. Marcus's upload. Dr. Tanaka's defectors. The resistance extractions. And the murder that had prompted the erasure.

At 20:00, Maria returned with recordings of border guard testimony. Guard Volkov and Agent Chen both remembered Isaiah's crossing, confirmed the timestamp, described the system chaos.

"They'll testify formally if needed," Maria said. "You're building a strong case."

"It's not just for me. It's for everyone affected by the erasure. We're all in this together—proving that truth exists even when records don't."

"When do you publish?"

"Tomorrow morning. Before Veridica has time to pressure SFW more. Before anyone else gets arrested or deported. Before the killer has time to eliminate more witnesses."

"You realize this makes you a primary target? Whoever erased the hour won't want you publishing evidence that it happened."

"Then they'll have to act quickly. And acting quickly usually means making mistakes." Isaiah saved his work. "Besides, I'm not alone. Marcus, Kira, Dr. Tanaka, the Volkovs—we're all documenting the lost hour. We're all building cases. We're all proving that human testimony matters."

"You're creating a new legal doctrine."

"We're creating proof that Histologic law needs to evolve. That The Judge isn't infallible. That absolute certainty is impossible." Isaiah pulled up his publication queue. "Tomorrow at 08:00, this goes live. By 09:00, millions will know the lost hour existed. By 10:00, Veridica will have to respond. And by then, the truth will be too public to suppress."

Maria smiled. "The fourth estate strikes back."

"The fourth estate remembers. Because that's what we do. We document. We record. We remember. And we make sure others remember too."
