# Chapter 3: The Suspects

## POV: Thomas Wei

## November 15, 2106 - 15:30

Thomas Wei sat in Conference Room 12-B, surrounded by junior technicians who hung on his every word, and permitted himself a moment of satisfaction. Everything was proceeding exactly as planned.

The factorepo failure had been discovered at 15:01—predictable, given the automated integrity check. Kozlov's body had been found at 15:05—also predictable, given his aide's punctuality. And now, at 15:30, Wei was exactly where he needed to be: in charge of the investigation into the very crime he'd committed.

"The deletion code is sophisticated," he explained to the assembled technicians, displaying fragments on the brass-framed screens. "Inserted over months, hidden in legitimate system updates, designed to activate at a specific time. Whoever did this understands our architecture intimately."

Jakob Petersen, one of the sharper technicians, leaned forward. "Sir, can we trace the code insertion? Find out who had access to these particular modules?"

"Already working on it," Wei lied smoothly. "But understand—anyone with senior architect clearance could have done this. That's about thirty people across the organization."

"Thirty suspects," Maya Reeves said quietly from the back of the room.

Wei glanced at her. The young technician who'd discovered the erasure. Smart, observant, potentially dangerous. He'd need to watch her carefully.

"Thirty possible suspects," Wei corrected. "But we'll narrow it down through access logs, behavioral analysis, and motive assessment. Someone wanted that hour erased. We find out why, we find out who."

"Minister Kozlov was murdered during the lost hour," another technician offered. "Is that connected?"

"Almost certainly." Wei pulled up a timeline display. "Consider the sequence: at 14:00, the erasure protocol activates. At some point between 14:00 and 15:00, Minister Kozlov is killed. At 15:00, the erasure completes. The timing is too precise to be coincidental."

"So someone killed the Minister and erased the hour to cover it up," Maya said. Her eyes were locked on Wei's face, studying him.

"That's one theory," Wei acknowledged. "Another theory: multiple parties were operating during that hour. The resistance was conducting extractions—we have reports of missing inmates from twelve correction facilities. Someone was using the chaos as cover for murder. The erasure might have been planned separately, for different purposes."

"What purposes?" Jakob asked.

Wei spread his hands. "That's what we need to determine. Was the primary goal murder, or was it erasing evidence of something else? Was Kozlov the target, or was he collateral damage?"

The technicians murmured among themselves. Wei watched them absorb his carefully crafted narrative—one that positioned the murder as possibly secondary to other operations, one that suggested multiple suspects, one that created confusion rather than clarity.

Perfect.

His comm device vibrated. Message from Director Petrov:

**WEI - CAPTAIN SOKOLOV WANTS YOUR BACKGROUND FILES. SYSTEM ACCESS LOGS, PERSONAL HISTORY, KNOWN ASSOCIATES. SHOULD I PROVIDE THEM? - PETROV**

Wei's pulse spiked, but his expression remained calm. Sokolov was investigating him. Faster than he'd expected.

He typed a reply:

**OF COURSE. FULL COOPERATION WITH SECURITY INVESTIGATION. I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE. SEND EVERYTHING SHE REQUESTS. - WEI**

The best way to appear innocent was to act innocent. Provide the files, let them investigate, maintain the facade of helpful cooperation. His tracks were covered. The access logs had been carefully sanitized. The code insertion patterns had been disguised. He'd been planning this for three months—he wasn't going to be caught by a simple background check.

"Sir?" Maya's voice cut through his thoughts. "Are you alright?"

Wei realized he'd been staring at his comm device. "Fine. Just Director Petrov with an update. Captain Sokolov wants our full cooperation with the murder investigation."

"Of course," Maya said. "We all want to find the killer."

The way she emphasized "all" made Wei's instincts prickle. Did she suspect him? Had she noticed something in the code? Was she playing her own game?

No. She was just a junior technician. Smart, yes, but inexperienced. She didn't have the skills or the context to identify him as the architect of the erasure.

Probably.

"Maya," Wei said carefully. "You're the one who discovered the erasure. Walk us through it again. What exactly did you see at 15:01?"

Maya stood, moving to the display screen with confidence that suggested she'd been waiting for this question. "The automated integrity check runs at 15:00 every day. It compares real-time data against historical baselines. At 15:01, it reported a critical discrepancy—sixty minutes of data completely missing. I ran diagnostics and confirmed: the hour from 14:00 to 15:00 had been deleted from all primary and backup systems."

"All of them?" Wei asked, as if surprised. "That should be impossible."

"It should be," Maya agreed. "But someone found a way. They inserted code into the backup synchronization protocol—code that corrupted data sequentially across all redundant systems. By the time the hour ended, every copy of that hour's data was gone."

"And you found this code?"

"Jakob found the code insertion. I found the execution pattern." Maya pulled up the deletion sequence. "See how it worked backward from newest to oldest? That's deliberate. It ensures that even if one system detects the corruption, there's no clean backup to restore from. Whoever designed this understood not just our architecture but our recovery procedures."

Wei studied the screen, hiding his pride in his own work. It was elegant. It was thorough. It was exactly what he'd designed it to be.

"Excellent analysis," he said. "This helps us narrow the suspect pool. We're looking for someone with deep architectural knowledge, access to backup protocols, and advanced coding skills."

"Someone like you, sir," Maya said.

The room went silent.

Wei smiled, the picture of amused innocence. "Indeed. Someone exactly like me. Or Jakob. Or Director Petrov. Or any of the senior architects in the organization." He met her eyes directly. "Is there a reason you're suggesting me specifically?"

"No, sir," Maya said, not breaking eye contact. "Just establishing that it takes someone of your caliber to pull this off. Which helps us narrow suspects."

"Quite right." Wei turned to the rest of the group. "Let's create a list. Who has the technical skills and system access to execute this erasure? Cross-reference that with anyone who might have wanted Minister Kozlov dead. Where those lists intersect, we'll find our killer."

The technicians returned to their work. Wei pulled Maya aside.

"You're sharp," he said quietly. "Sharper than most junior technicians. Where did you learn system architecture?"

"Self-taught, mostly. I study the senior architects' code during my off hours. Trying to learn from the best." She paused. "Your optimization patterns are particularly elegant, sir. I recognize your signature in a lot of our core systems."

"Flattering. And concerning."

"Concerning?"

"If you can recognize my coding signature, you might recognize someone else's in the deletion code. Have you analyzed it for distinctive patterns?"

Maya's expression shifted—just slightly, just enough to confirm Wei's suspicion. She had analyzed it. And she'd found patterns.

"Not yet, sir," she lied. "But I will."

"Good. Report your findings to me directly. I want to know if you spot any familiar signatures."

"Of course, sir."

Wei watched her return to her terminal. She was lying. She'd already spotted something. And she was smart enough not to reveal it.

Which meant he had a problem.

Not insurmountable. Just... requiring attention.

At 18:00, Wei left the conference room and headed to his private office. Time to assess the situation and plan his next moves.

The murder had gone perfectly. Kozlov had been expecting Marcus Chen at 14:30. Instead, Wei had arrived at 14:23, entered the office using his administrative override, and shot the Minister before he could react. Quick. Clean. Professional.

The erasure had also gone perfectly. The deletion code had activated exactly on schedule, corrupting data across all systems within the one-hour window. By 15:01, the hour was lost—irretrievably, completely, perfectly.

But three things were going wrong.

First: Captain Sokolov was smarter than Wei had anticipated. Instead of immediately blaming Marcus Chen—the obvious suspect—she was investigating methodically, checking backgrounds, analyzing motives. She'd requested Wei's files specifically, which meant someone had pointed her in his direction.

Probably Maya.

Second: The outlaws were organizing. Marcus Chen, Kira Osman, and their allies were meeting, comparing notes, reconstructing the lost hour from fragments and memories. If they succeeded, they might piece together enough evidence to challenge Wei's narrative.

Third: Maya Reeves had recognized his coding signature in the deletion code.

That was the most immediate problem. If Maya told Sokolov, if she provided evidence linking Wei to the erasure, the entire plan would unravel. He'd be investigated, possibly arrested, certainly exposed.

Unless Maya had an accident.

Wei pulled up her personnel file. Twenty-six years old. No family—parents deceased, no siblings. Few close friends. Lived alone in a small apartment in the residential quarter. Walked home from work most evenings, passing through several poorly-lit streets.

Accidents happened in poorly-lit streets.

But no. Too obvious. Too soon after the murder. Another death would raise suspicions, especially if the victim was investigating the first death.

He needed a subtler approach.

Wei pulled up the investigation files and began crafting his next move: redirect suspicion toward Marcus Chen. The outlaw had motive—Kozlov was supposed to help him expose corruption. He had opportunity—he was near the Minister's office during the lost hour (probably). He had means—outlaws had access to weapons.

And most importantly, Marcus Chen couldn't prove he didn't do it. Because the hour was lost. Because there was no factorepo record. Because Wei had erased the only evidence that could clear Chen.

Perfect.

Wei composed a message to Captain Sokolov:

**CAPTAIN - ANALYSIS OF DELETION CODE REVEALS POSSIBLE RESISTANCE INVOLVEMENT. CODE STYLE MATCHES PATTERNS SEEN IN PREVIOUS OUTLAW OPERATIONS. RECOMMEND FOCUSING INVESTIGATION ON MARCUS CHEN AND ASSOCIATES. FULL REPORT TO FOLLOW. - WEI**

He hesitated before sending. Was it too obvious? Too convenient?

No. It was exactly what Sokolov would expect to hear from the lead technical investigator. Especially since it was partially true—the code did use some techniques common in resistance operations. Wei had deliberately copied those patterns to create exactly this misdirection.

He sent the message.

Then he composed a second message, this one encrypted and routed through multiple proxies:

**SYNTHESIS - OPERATION COMPLETE. TARGET ELIMINATED. HOUR ERASED. MINOR COMPLICATIONS WITH INVESTIGATION. MANAGING. WILL REPORT PROGRESS. - W**

The reply came within seconds:

**ACKNOWLEDGED. MANAGE COMPLICATIONS. ELIMINATE WITNESSES IF NECESSARY. ARCHITECTS WILL PROTECT YOU, BUT ONLY IF YOU SUCCEED COMPLETELY. NO LOOSE ENDS. - SYNTHESIS**

Eliminate witnesses if necessary.

Wei looked at Maya's personnel file again. Young. Smart. Dedicated. Just trying to do her job and find the truth.

And potentially the one person who could expose him.

He closed the file. He wasn't a monster. He'd killed Kozlov out of necessity—the Minister was going to expose programs critical to The Architects' plans. That was justifiable. Strategic. Required.

But Maya? She was just a technician. Just someone in the wrong place at the wrong time, who'd seen too much and understood too much.

Eliminating her would be...

Necessary.

Wei hated that word. Hated what it implied. Hated what it required.

But The Architects didn't tolerate failure. And Wei didn't tolerate loose ends.

He pulled up the security schedules. Maya's shift ended at 20:00. She usually left through the east exit, walked through the industrial quarter, reached her apartment around 20:30.

Tonight, she would have an accident. A mugging, perhaps. Or a mechanical failure—one of the steam pipes that lined the streets, bursting at an unfortunate moment. Tragic. Regrettable. Unavoidable.

And afterward, the investigation would lose its sharpest mind. The one person who'd recognized Wei's signature would be gone. The path would be clear to frame Marcus Chen.

Wei checked his chronometer: 18:15.

Less than two hours until Maya's shift ended.

Less than two hours until he committed his second murder.

He sat in his office, staring at her file, and wondered when he'd become the kind of person who could calculate the logistics of murder with the same precision he used for system architecture.

The answer, he realized, was three months ago. When The Architects had approached him with an offer: unlimited access, unlimited resources, unlimited protection.

In exchange for doing what was necessary.

And eliminating a young technician who knew too much was, unfortunately, necessary.

Wei stood, pocketed his personal weapon, and prepared for the evening ahead.
