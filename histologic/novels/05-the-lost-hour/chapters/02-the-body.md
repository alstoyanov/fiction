# Chapter 2: The Body

## POV: Captain Yevgenia Sokolov

## November 15, 2106 - 15:05

The call came through on Yevgenia Sokolov's direct line, interrupting her review of border security reports from the afternoon's chaos. Sixteen unauthorized crossings. Twenty-three system failures. Forty-eight missing persons reports—all from correction facilities.

Something big had happened between 14:00 and 15:00. She just hadn't known how big.

"Captain Sokolov," she answered.

"Captain, this is Security Chief Ramos at the Executive Building. We have a Code Black on the fortieth floor. Minister Kozlov's office."

Yevgenia was already moving, grabbing her brass-buttoned coat. "Details."

"Body. Single gunshot. No signs of struggle. The Minister's aide found him at her desk at 15:05."

"At her desk? Not at his?"

"At her desk, Captain. She'd been waiting for him to finish a private meeting. When he didn't emerge by 15:00, she went to check on him. Found him slumped over his desk, dead."

"Secure the scene. No one in or out. I'll be there in ten minutes."

"Yes, Captain. One more thing—"

"What?"

"The factorepo is showing errors. We can't access surveillance footage from this afternoon. We can't verify who entered or exited the building. Systems are saying the data is... missing."

Yevgenia stopped walking. "Missing how?"

"Just missing, Captain. Like it was never recorded."

She resumed walking, faster now. "I'm on my way."

---

The Executive Building rose forty-three floors above the city—all brass and copper and glass, a monument to governmental efficiency. Yevgenia had been here hundreds of times for security briefings, policy meetings, coordination sessions. She'd never responded to a murder here.

Ministers didn't get murdered. Not in Veridica. Not in a Histologic nation where every moment was recorded, every action logged, every crime immediately detectable.

Except, apparently, during hours that went missing.

The fortieth floor was chaos controlled by procedure. Her security team had established a perimeter. Crime scene technicians were setting up equipment. Medical examiner Dr. Amara Park was already examining the body.

And in the center of it all, slumped over an ornate brass desk, was Minister Viktor Kozlov.

Yevgenia approached slowly, taking in details. Kozlov sat in his leather chair, upper body collapsed onto the desk, left arm extended as if reaching for something. Blood pooled beneath his head—not much, surprisingly little. Single entry wound to the back of the skull. Professional. Precise. Execution-style.

"Time of death?" she asked Dr. Park.

"Difficult to determine precisely. Body temperature suggests between one and two hours ago." Park checked her chronometer: 15:27. "So somewhere between 13:30 and 14:30."

"Can you narrow it down?"

"Not without accessing the factorepo for environmental data—room temperature fluctuations, air circulation patterns, system logs. But apparently—" Park's expression was grim, "—the factorepo is currently experiencing issues."

"The data is gone," Yevgenia confirmed. "From 14:00 to 15:00. Completely gone."

Park's hands stilled over the body. "That's when he died. During the missing hour."

"Convenient."

"Too convenient." Park resumed her examination. "Single shot, close range, probably from the doorway based on angle. Victim didn't see it coming—no defensive wounds, no sign he tried to turn or protect himself. He was sitting at his desk, working or meeting with someone, and someone shot him from behind."

Yevgenia looked around the office. Everything was orderly—papers neatly stacked, terminals displaying official documents, brass lamps casting warm light. No signs of struggle or search. Nothing obviously missing or disturbed.

"His personal terminal is still logged in," she noted. "So he was working right before he died."

"Or meeting with someone he trusted enough to leave his terminal unsecured."

Yevgenia approached the desk carefully, noting the blood spatter pattern, the position of items. Kozlov's right hand lay near a brass pen. His left extended toward a drawer that was slightly open.

She photographed everything before touching anything. In a Histologic nation, crime scene procedure was built around the assumption that The Judge would have perfect records. Without factorepo data, she had to rely on old methods—physical evidence, witness testimony, deductive reasoning.

Methods she'd learned at the Academy but rarely used.

She pulled on copper-mesh gloves and carefully opened the drawer Kozlov had been reaching toward. Inside: standard office supplies, a few personal items, and a brass key on a chain.

"Bag this," she told a technician, indicating the key. "And check what it opens."

She turned to Security Chief Ramos. "Who found the body?"

"Maya Reeves, the Minister's aide. She's in the conference room, pretty shaken."

"Anyone else with access to this floor?"

"During normal hours? About forty staff members. But during the afternoon—" Ramos checked his tablet. "System shows badge access for seventeen people between 13:00 and 16:00. Except for one hour where the logs are corrupted."

"Let me guess: 14:00 to 15:00."

"Exactly. We have records before and after, but that hour is just... blank."

Yevgenia walked to the window, thinking. Forty-three floors up, the city spread beneath her like a brass and copper puzzle. Somewhere down there, a killer had entered this building, come to this floor, shot Minister Kozlov, and left.

All during an hour that no longer existed in the factorepo.

"Chief Ramos, I need something from you."

"Yes, Captain?"

"Start with what we know: who had access to this floor at 13:59? Who was logged in the building right before the hour disappeared?"

Ramos pulled up the logs. "Seventeen people, like I said. Eleven staff members working in various offices. Four Ministers or their aides. And two technicians doing maintenance."

"Names of the technicians?"

"Jakob Petersen and... Thomas Wei."

Yevgenia filed that name away. "Where are they now?"

"Petersen is downstairs in the factorepo operations center. Wei is..." Ramos checked. "Conference Room 12-B. He's been there since 14:55, leading an investigation into the factorepo failure."

"How convenient that he's investigating a problem that benefited this murder."

"Captain, you think—?"

"I think nothing yet. But I want to talk to Thomas Wei." Yevgenia turned from the window. "After I talk to the aide who found the body."

Maya Reeves sat in Conference Room 8-A, hands wrapped around a cup of tea she wasn't drinking. She was young—mid-twenties, Yevgenia estimated—with the focused intensity of someone who worked with systems more than people.

"Miss Reeves," Yevgenia sat across from her. "I know this is difficult. But I need to ask you some questions."

"I understand, Captain." Maya's voice was steady despite her pale face. "I want to help. Minister Kozlov was a good man. He deserves justice."

"Tell me about this afternoon. When did you last see the Minister alive?"

"At 14:25. He had a private meeting scheduled for 14:30, and I asked if he needed anything before it started. He said no, that I should take a break, come back at 15:00." Maya's hands tightened on the cup. "He seemed... nervous. More nervous than usual. But determined. Like he'd made a difficult decision and was committed to it."

"Did he tell you who the meeting was with?"

"No. He just said it was someone important. Someone he needed to talk to about..." Maya hesitated. "About telling the truth."

"Telling the truth about what?"

"I don't know specifically. But the Minister had been acting differently these past few weeks. He'd been reviewing old files, meeting with unusual contacts, writing letters late at night. I think he was preparing to expose something. Something he'd been complicit in."

Yevgenia made notes. "And the meeting at 14:30—did it happen?"

"I don't know. I left at 14:25 like he asked. Went to the staff break room on the thirty-eighth floor. Came back at 15:00. His office door was closed, which was normal if he was in a meeting. But by 15:05, I started to worry. He's always punctual. If a meeting runs long, he messages me. But I hadn't heard anything."

"So you entered the office?"

Maya nodded, tears finally forming. "I knocked first. No answer. I opened the door, and he was..." She stopped, swallowed. "He was just sitting there. At first I thought he'd fallen asleep. But then I saw the blood."

"What did you do?"

"I checked for a pulse. There wasn't one. I called security. Then I..." Maya looked up, meeting Yevgenia's eyes. "Then I noticed his terminal was still logged in. Showing a document titled 'Confession.' I didn't read it—I didn't touch anything after I checked his pulse. But I saw the title."

"A confession to what?"

"I don't know. But Captain, there's something else you need to know." Maya leaned forward. "I work in the factorepo operations center part-time. I'm one of the technicians who monitors system integrity. This afternoon at 15:01, I discovered that an hour of data has been erased. From 14:00 to 15:00. The exact hour when Minister Kozlov died."

"You're saying someone deliberately erased that hour to cover up this murder?"

"I'm saying it's too coincidental to be coincidence. Erasing an hour of factorepo data requires sophisticated technical knowledge and high-level system access. Very few people could do it. And whoever killed the Minister did it during the exact hour that was erased. They knew the data would be gone. They planned it that way."

Yevgenia studied the young woman. Smart. Observant. Already thinking like an investigator.

"Miss Reeves, I'm going to need your help with this investigation. Someone who understands the technical systems."

"I want to help, Captain. Minister Kozlov gave me this job when no one else would hire me. He believed in second chances." Maya's jaw set. "Whoever killed him took away his chance to tell the truth. I want to make sure his death exposes what he died trying to reveal."

"Then help me understand: if someone erased that hour, can we recover it?"

"I don't know. Maybe partial data from edge caches or system logs. But complete recovery? No. Once data is deleted from all backup systems, it's gone. That hour is lost forever."

"Then we investigate the old way. With witness testimony and physical evidence."

"In a Histologic nation," Maya said quietly. "Where our entire legal system is built on the assumption that everything is recorded and nothing is uncertain."

"Then we'll prove the system can adapt." Yevgenia stood. "I need you to compile a list of everyone with the technical skills and system access to erase that hour. And everyone who might have wanted Minister Kozlov dead. We'll cross-reference and find our suspect."

"I can do that. But Captain—" Maya hesitated. "There's one more thing. That brass key in the Minister's desk drawer. I think I know what it opens."

"What?"

"A safety deposit box. At the Veridica Archive Vault. The Minister mentioned it once, said he was storing important documents there. Documents that would survive even if he didn't."

Yevgenia's pulse quickened. "Can we access it?"

"With the key and proper authorization, yes. But we'll need a warrant from The Judge—" Maya stopped. "Except The Judge can't issue warrants based on missing data. We have no factorepo record that a crime was even committed during that hour."

"Then we work around it. The body is real, even if the factorepo doesn't record when he died. The murder is real, even if we can't prove exactly when it happened. We build a case based on what we can prove, and we use that to get authorization."

Maya stood as well. "I'll help however I can, Captain."

"Good. Start with that list of suspects. Anyone with technical capability and possible motive." Yevgenia walked to the door, then paused. "One more question: you said you work in the factorepo operations center. Have you noticed anyone acting suspiciously around the systems? Anyone accessing things they shouldn't?"

Maya's expression shifted—not quite concealing something, but carefully considering her words. "There is one person. Thomas Wei. Senior Systems Architect. He's been accessing unusual code repositories, meeting with unauthorized contacts, and his activity logs show he was working on something in the backup synchronization protocols. Something he encrypted heavily."

"Where is Wei now?"

"Leading the investigation into the factorepo failure."

Yevgenia's smiled was sharp and cold. "How very helpful of him. To investigate his own crime."

"Captain, we don't know for certain that Wei—"

"No, we don't. But we will. Thank you, Miss Reeves. Report to me tomorrow at 08:00. We have a murder to solve and an hour to reconstruct."

Yevgenia returned to Kozlov's office where Dr. Park was finishing her examination.

"Anything new?" Yevgenia asked.

"Powder residue suggests the shooter was approximately three meters away. Standing in the doorway, as I suspected. The angle of entry indicates someone of average height—between 170 and 180 centimeters. The precision suggests either professional training or significant practice."

"So we're looking for someone with technical skills, system access, and weapons training. That narrows it down."

"Captain?" A technician called from the doorway. "We found something in the trash receptacle. Looks like Minister Kozlov was printing documents before he died."

Yevgenia walked over. The technician held a crumpled piece of paper—high-quality stock with the Minister's seal. Most of it was burned, but a few words remained legible:

*"...forty years of complicity... The Architects... correction facility program... fact storm weapons... can no longer remain silent... meeting with Marcus Chen at 14:30..."*

Marcus Chen. The escaped outlaw. The reformer.

"Kozlov was meeting with Marcus Chen," Yevgenia said. "An outlaw. In his office. About exposing government corruption."

"And someone killed him to prevent it," Dr. Park added.

"Someone who knew about the meeting. Someone who could access this floor during the missing hour. Someone who could erase the factorepo data to eliminate evidence."

Yevgenia pulled out her comm device and sent an urgent message to her team:

**PRIORITY: LOCATE MARCUS CHEN. LAST KNOWN MEETING WITH MINISTER KOZLOV AT 14:30. SUSPECT IN MURDER INVESTIGATION. BRING IN FOR QUESTIONING. USE CAUTION—CHEN MAY BELIEVE HE'S BEING FRAMED. - SOKOLOV**

Then she sent a second message, this one to Director Petrov:

**NEED COMPLETE BACKGROUND ON THOMAS WEI. ALL SYSTEM ACCESS LOGS, PERSONAL HISTORY, KNOWN ASSOCIATES. TREAT AS CONFIDENTIAL INVESTIGATION. - SOKOLOV**

And a third message, to her most trusted operative:

**OPERATIVE SEVEN: SHADOW THOMAS WEI. DO NOT ENGAGE. OBSERVE AND REPORT. HE MAY BE OUR KILLER. - S**

She looked around Kozlov's office one more time. A good man, Maya had said. A man trying to tell the truth after forty years of lies. A man murdered during an hour that no longer existed.

"Dr. Park, how long until you complete the autopsy?"

"Two hours."

"Make it one. I need time of death as precise as possible, even without factorepo data. Stomach contents, liver temperature, rigor mortis progression—everything you can use to narrow the window."

"I'll do my best."

Yevgenia walked to the window and looked out at the city. Somewhere out there, a killer believed they'd committed the perfect crime. Murdered a Minister and erased the evidence in one coordinated operation.

But they'd made mistakes. They always did.

The burned note mentioning Marcus Chen. The brass key to a safety deposit box. Maya Reeves's sharp observations. Dr. Park's forensic analysis. Thomas Wei's suspicious behavior.

Pieces of a puzzle. Fragments of truth in an hour of missing history.

Yevgenia would reconstruct that hour. She would find the killer. She would prove that truth existed even when it wasn't recorded.

Because in the end, that's what being an enforcer meant—not just enforcing the law, but enforcing reality itself. Making sure that actions had consequences, even when those actions occurred in time that technically no longer existed.

Her comm device buzzed. Message from her team:

**MARCUS CHEN LOCATED. HE'S WITH KIRA OSMAN AND FIVE OTHERS AT THE COPPER ARCHIVES. THEY'RE MEETING WITH MAYA REEVES. AWAIT ORDERS. - TEAM ALPHA**

Yevgenia checked her chronometer: 23:52.

Maya was meeting with Marcus Chen. The aide who found the body was meeting with the man who was supposed to meet with the victim.

Either Maya was conspiring with the killer, or she was investigating on her own.

Yevgenia made her decision:

**MAINTAIN SURVEILLANCE. DO NOT ENGAGE. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING. - SOKOLOV**

Sometimes, the best way to catch a killer was to watch them investigate themselves.

And sometimes, the best allies were the ones the system called outlaws.
