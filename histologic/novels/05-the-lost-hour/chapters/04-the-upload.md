# Chapter 4: The Upload

## POV: Marcus Chen (Flashback)

## November 15, 2106 - 14:15 (During the Lost Hour)

Marcus's hands moved across the keyboard with practiced precision, but his heart raced like he was running for his life. In a way, he was.

"Encryption layer three complete," Kira announced from her station across the room. "Starting upload sequence in ten seconds."

The safe house hummed with the sound of overworked processors and cooling fans. Three months of evidence—corruption files, conviction records, proof of systematic manipulation—compressed into a single upload package. Three months of risk, research, and careful documentation, about to become permanent truth in the factorepo.

If they succeeded.

Marcus watched the progress bar: **READY TO UPLOAD - 47 MINUTES ESTIMATED**

14:15. They had forty-five minutes until the hour ended. Forty-five minutes until Elena's "chaos window" closed. It would be tight, but manageable.

"Kira, are you sure about the routing?"

"Seventeen proxy servers across eight nations," she replied without looking up. "Anonymized, encrypted, distributed. Even if they detect the upload in progress, they won't trace it back to us before it completes. And once it's in the factorepo..." She glanced at him, a slight smile. "Truth becomes permanent."

Marcus allowed himself a moment of hope. Three months ago, they'd escaped the correction facility. Three months ago, this had seemed impossible—two outlaws, hunted by the state, trying to expose the very system that had convicted them.

But they'd done it. Gathered evidence. Built a network. Found allies. And now, in forty-seven minutes, they would prove that Veridica's Histologic system had been corrupted by human greed and political manipulation.

"Upload starting," Kira said. "Now."

The progress bar began to move: **1%... 2%... 3%...**

Marcus stood and walked to the window. The safe house overlooked the industrial district—brass pipes gleaming in afternoon light, steam rising from processing centers, the orderly beauty of a Histologic city operating exactly as designed.

Except it wasn't. Beneath that orderly beauty, corruption festered. Officials manipulated facts for political gain. The Architects—whoever they were—pulled strings from shadows. Innocent people were convicted to protect powerful secrets.

And in forty-five minutes, the world would know.

His comm device buzzed. Message from Nikolai:

**UNUSUAL ACTIVITY IN FACTOREPO SYSTEMS. SOMEONE DOING SOMETHING AT 14:00. I DON'T KNOW WHAT. STAY ALERT. - N**

Marcus showed it to Kira.

"Should we abort?" she asked.

"Can we?"

"Not without losing everything. Once the upload starts, stopping it early would corrupt the data package. We'd have to start over."

"Then we continue. Whatever Nikolai detected, we trust Elena's window. Too many operations happening simultaneously for authorities to respond to all of them."

**15%... 16%... 17%...**

The upload progressed steadily. Marcus tried to relax, tried to trust their planning. They'd chosen this hour carefully. Elena's resistance operations would create chaos—extractions from twelve facilities, defectors crossing borders, coordinated distractions. The authorities would be overwhelmed.

And in that chaos, two outlaws would upload truth.

"Marcus." Kira's voice had an edge. "I'm detecting anomalies in the backup synchronization protocols."

"What kind of anomalies?"

"Someone's running a deletion script. Active right now. It's... it's corrupting recent data across multiple backup systems."

Marcus moved to her station. "Show me."

Kira pulled up the system monitors. Red warnings cascaded across the screen—backup corruption, data integrity failures, synchronization errors.

"This is deliberate," Kira said. "Someone's attacking the backup systems. But why?"

"To erase something. Something happening right now. During this hour." Marcus felt cold understanding. "Someone else is using Elena's chaos window. For something they want erased."

"If they're erasing backups, our upload might be erased too."

"Not if we complete it before the corruption reaches it. How long until we finish?"

**32%... 33%... 34%...**

"Thirty-two minutes remaining."

"And the corruption? How fast is it spreading?"

Kira ran calculations. "It's working backward from current time, corrupting sequentially. At this rate, it'll reach our upload around... around 15:00."

"The exact moment the hour ends."

They stared at each other.

"Someone planned this," Marcus said. "Someone knew there would be operations during this hour. They're erasing the entire hour to cover something up."

"Should we—"

"No. We continue. Our evidence gets uploaded to the secure servers before the corruption reaches it. Even if the factorepo backups are erased, our data will be safe in the archives. We just have to finish before 15:00."

**42%... 43%... 44%...**

Marcus returned to monitoring the upload. Twenty-eight minutes. They could make it.

His comm device buzzed again. This time from Dmitri:

**BROTHER - WITNESSED SOMETHING STRANGE. SOMEONE ENTERED EXECUTIVE BUILDING AT 14:20. WRONG HEIGHT FOR MARCUS. WRONG MOVEMENT PATTERN. THERE'S ANOTHER OPERATION HAPPENING. STAY SAFE. - D**

Someone entering the Executive Building. Where Kozlov's office was. Where Marcus was supposed to meet the Minister at 14:30.

"Kira, what time is it?"

"14:28."

Two minutes until his scheduled meeting with Kozlov. The meeting he couldn't attend because he was here, uploading evidence. The meeting where Kozlov was supposed to provide testimony about forty years of corruption.

The meeting someone else had just attended.

"Something's wrong," Marcus said. "Kozlov. Someone's going after Kozlov."

"You can't help him. If you leave now, you blow your cover. The upload is only halfway complete."

"But if someone's targeting him—"

"Then he's already dead or safe. Either way, you can't reach him in time. And if you try, you'll be caught near the scene of whatever's happening." Kira's voice was firm. "Marcus, we finish the upload. That's how we honor Kozlov's sacrifice—by making sure the truth he died for gets recorded."

Marcus hated it. Hated feeling helpless. Hated that someone might be killing a good man while he sat here watching a progress bar.

But Kira was right. Rushing to Kozlov's aid would accomplish nothing except getting Marcus captured. And the evidence mattered more than one man's life.

Even if that man was risking everything to help them.

**58%... 59%... 60%...**

The minutes crawled past. Marcus monitored the upload with half his attention while the other half imagined what might be happening at the Executive Building. Kozlov waiting for him. A killer arriving instead. A shot. A body.

And an hour being erased to cover it all up.

At 14:35, another message from Dmitri:

**HEARD SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GUNSHOT. CAN'T CONFIRM. PROCEEDING WITH EXTRACTION. GOOD LUCK. - D**

A gunshot. At 14:35. Which would put Kozlov's time of death somewhere around 14:23, when the unknown person entered.

Marcus felt sick. A good man, murdered. A witness, silenced. All while Marcus sat safely in a hiding place, uploading files.

"It's not your fault," Kira said quietly, reading his expression.

"I should have been there."

"Then you'd be dead too. Or framed for his murder. Whoever did this planned it carefully—they knew you were supposed to meet Kozlov. They probably intended to blame you. By not being there, you've already foiled part of their plan."

"But Kozlov—"

"Kozlov chose to help us knowing the risks. The best way to honor that choice is to finish what we started."

**75%... 76%... 77%...**

At 14:45, the upload passed three-quarters complete. Marcus started to believe they might actually succeed.

Then the alarms started.

Not physical alarms—digital ones. Warnings cascading across Kira's monitors. The backup corruption was accelerating, spreading faster than anticipated.

"It's adapting," Kira said, fingers flying across her keyboard. "The deletion script is learning from system responses, optimizing its spread. It'll reach our upload in fifteen minutes, not thirty."

"Can we speed up the upload?"

"Not without risking data corruption. We're already at maximum safe bandwidth."

Marcus checked the progress: **82%... 83%... 84%...**

Eighteen percent remaining. Fifteen minutes until the deletion script reached them.

They were going to lose.

"Wait," Kira said. "I can buy us time. If I redirect the deletion script through a recursive loop... it'll confuse its targeting algorithm, slow it down by maybe five minutes."

"Do it."

Kira's hands moved like a pianist's, writing code in real-time, injecting it into the system, redirecting the attacker's own weapon against itself.

The cascade of warnings slowed. Not stopped, but slowed.

"That bought us five minutes," Kira confirmed. "But that's all I can do. We have twenty minutes to upload eighteen percent."

They could make it. Barely. If nothing else went wrong.

**88%... 89%... 90%...**

At 14:52, with eight minutes remaining and ten percent left to upload, Marcus allowed himself to hope.

The evidence would be recorded. Kozlov's death wouldn't be in vain. The truth about Veridica's corruption would become permanent fact, accessible to anyone who knew where to look.

And in the future—maybe not tomorrow, maybe not next week, but eventually—that truth would force change.

**94%... 95%... 96%...**

"Four minutes," Kira said. "We're going to make it."

**97%... 98%... 99%...**

The progress bar seemed to pause at 99%, taunting them. Marcus held his breath.

Then: **100% - UPLOAD COMPLETE - VERIFYING...**

"Verification takes thirty seconds," Kira said. "Then it's permanent."

Marcus watched the verification progress. Twenty seconds. Fifteen. Ten.

**VERIFICATION COMPLETE - DATA INTEGRATED INTO SECURE ARCHIVE - TIMESTAMP: 14:54:27**

They'd done it.

Three months of work. Forty-seven minutes of tension. And now, forever, the truth about Veridica's corruption existed in the factorepo's secure archives.

Unless someone deleted those archives too.

"Kira, the deletion script—"

"Corrupting the current hour's backups, not the archives. Our data is safe. It's timestamped before the hour started, so the deletion won't reach it."

Marcus leaned back, exhaling tension he hadn't realized he'd been holding. "We did it."

"We did it," Kira confirmed. She stood, crossed the room, and kissed him. "Three months of hiding. Three months of planning. And we actually did it."

They held each other for a moment—two outlaws who'd fallen in love while fighting a corrupt system, who'd just struck the biggest blow against that system anyone had managed.

Marcus's comm device buzzed. Elena's message:

**ALL OPERATIONS COMPLETING SUCCESSFULLY. EXTRACTION AT 98%. DEFECTIONS CONFIRMED. BORDER CROSSINGS SUCCESSFUL. WHATEVER YOU WERE DOING, FINISH IT. HOUR ENDS IN SIX MINUTES. - E**

Six minutes. Then the chaos window would close. Then the factorepo's automated systems would detect the corruption. Then all hell would break loose.

"We need to leave," Marcus said. "Now."

They grabbed their equipment, wiped the workstations, and headed for the exit. At 14:56, they stepped out into the industrial district's afternoon steam, just two more citizens walking through the brass-lined streets.

At 14:58, they reached the underground transit station.

At 14:59, they boarded a train heading to the residential quarter.

At 15:00, the hour ended.

And somewhere in the factorepo systems, an hour of history was erased.

But the evidence remained. Hidden in secure archives. Timestamped and verified. Waiting to be discovered.

Marcus didn't know yet that he'd be accused of murder. Didn't know that Kozlov was dead. Didn't know that someone had erased the hour specifically to cover up that murder.

He just knew they'd succeeded. They'd uploaded the truth. And nothing could erase that.

At 15:01, sitting on the train next to Kira, Marcus finally relaxed.

"We did it," he said again.

"We did," Kira agreed. "Now we just have to survive the aftermath."
