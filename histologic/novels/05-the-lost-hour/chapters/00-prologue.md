# Prologue: The Day Before

## November 14, 2106 - Evening

### Marcus and Kira - Veridica

The safe house overlooked the industrial district—all brass pipes and copper rooftops catching the last light of day. Marcus stood at the window, watching steam rise from the factorepo processing center three blocks away. Tomorrow, that building would become the center of a mystery that would change everything.

He just didn't know it yet.

"Final check," Kira said from her workstation, fingers dancing across three keyboards simultaneously. Screens surrounded her like a cathedral of glowing data. "Encryption: triple-layered. Upload route: anonymized through seventeen proxies. Backup location: secure server in neutral territory. Evidence package: complete."

Marcus turned from the window. "How long will the upload take?"

"Forty-seven minutes." Kira's eyes never left her screens. "I've compressed it as much as possible without losing integrity. Three months of corruption evidence, hundreds of conviction files, proof that Minister Chen Zhao is one of The Architects. It's all here."

"And tomorrow between 14:00 and 15:00, we upload it."

"Why that window?" Kira asked, though she'd asked before. She liked redundancy in her plans.

"Because Elena said something big is happening then. Multiple resistance operations. System chaos. The perfect cover." Marcus moved to stand behind her, his hand resting on her shoulder. "We upload the evidence, it propagates through the factorepo before anyone notices, and by the time the dust settles, the truth is permanent."

Kira saved her work and swiveled to face him. "You realize if this fails, we're not just outlaws anymore. We're dead outlaws."

"It won't fail. You've planned it perfectly."

"I've planned the technical side perfectly." She stood, closing the distance between them. "But technical isn't everything. People are unpredictable. Elena's operations could go wrong. The timing could be off. The Judge could—"

Marcus silenced her with a kiss. When they separated, he said, "We survived a correction facility, orchestrated a mass escape, and built a resistance network while being hunted. Tomorrow is just another operation."

"Tomorrow is THE operation. This is what we escaped for. This is what we've been working toward." Kira returned to her screens. "Tomorrow, we prove they're corrupt. Tomorrow, we force the system to acknowledge the truth. Tomorrow, everything changes."

"Again," Marcus added with a slight smile.

"Again," she agreed.

They worked in comfortable silence, making final preparations. At 22:00, Marcus's comm device chimed. Elena's message glowed on the screen:

**MARCUS, KIRA - TOMORROW, BETWEEN 14:00 AND 15:00, SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING. THE RESISTANCE IS PLANNING AN OPERATION. MULTIPLE OPERATIONS. AND SOMEONE IN THE GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING SOMETHING TOO. IT'S GOING TO BE CHAOS.**

**DOCUMENT EVERYTHING. WHATEVER HAPPENS TOMORROW, MAKE SURE IT'S RECORDED.**

**AND ONE MORE THING: BE CAREFUL. STAY SAFE. STAY TOGETHER. I HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT TOMORROW. SOMETHING'S GOING TO GO WRONG. I DON'T KNOW WHAT. BUT SOMETHING.**

**I LOVE YOU BOTH. STAY ALIVE. - E**

Marcus showed the message to Kira. Her expression darkened.

"Elena never has bad feelings," Kira said quietly. "She's always confident. Always certain about operations."

"Maybe she's learning uncertainty. Like we did."

"Or maybe she knows something we don't." Kira pulled up her monitoring suite. "I'm setting up additional recording. If something goes wrong tomorrow, I want every byte documented."

"Good idea." Marcus checked his chronometer. "We should rest. Tomorrow at 14:00, we make history."

Neither of them could sleep that night. Tomorrow felt too big, too important, too uncertain. So they sat together on the rooftop, watching the city's brass lights flicker through the steam, preparing for whatever came next.

Whatever happened tomorrow, they would face it together.

### Isaiah - SFW Border Territory

Isaiah Okonkwo sat in his sparse apartment in the SFW border city of New Liberty, reviewing his notes for tomorrow's assignment. Maria Santos had arranged three interviews—two with recently escaped correction facility inmates, one with a Chronos diplomat discussing sanctions against Veridica.

All scheduled between 14:00 and 15:00. Elena's exact window.

He'd questioned the timing when Maria proposed it, but she'd insisted: "These people are only available tomorrow afternoon. Take it or leave it."

Now, reading Elena's message again, Isaiah felt unease creep up his spine. Elena had been cryptic: *Document everything. Something big is happening.*

He set up his recording equipment with methodical care. Multiple cameras. Multiple audio devices. Redundant backups. Local storage and cloud synchronization. If something happened tomorrow, he would capture it. He would bear witness. He would tell the story.

That was his purpose now—chronicler of the resistance, documenter of truth, witness to history.

His tablet chimed. Message from an unknown sender:

**TOMORROW 14:30, CROSS THE BORDER AT CHECKPOINT SEVEN. BRING THE DOCUMENTS. YOU WILL BE EXPECTED. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO ESTABLISH LEGAL RESIDENCY. DON'T MISS IT. - A FRIEND**

Isaiah stared at the message. He'd been in SFW for three months on a temporary journalist visa, always uncertain of his status. The documents from the correction facility—evidence of systematic corruption—were his insurance policy. But they were also evidence that he'd illegally accessed government files.

Crossing the border officially, with documents in hand, during Elena's window of chaos...

It was either perfect timing or a trap.

Isaiah deleted the message and packed a travel bag. Tomorrow at 14:30, he would find out which.

He pulled up his notes and began writing:

*"On November 15, 2106, between 14:00 and 15:00, history was made. And then it was lost. This is the story of that hour—the hour that changed everything, the hour that disappeared, the hour that proved truth exists even when it cannot be recorded..."*

He stopped typing. Why was he writing as if the hour was already lost?

Shaking off the premonition, Isaiah saved his work and tried to sleep. Tomorrow would answer all his questions.

### Dr. Tanaka - Chronos

Dr. Yuki Tanaka stood in the Chronos parliament building, preparing for tomorrow's emergency session. The three-nation coalition—Chronos, Veritas, and Nova Factum—would vote on comprehensive sanctions against Veridica at 14:30. Economic pressure to force reform of the correction system.

She'd been invited to testify about neural correction procedures, about the ethical violations she'd witnessed, about why she'd refused to participate. Her testimony would influence the vote.

The weight of it pressed on her shoulders like lead.

In her office, three people waited nervously. A family: Amara and Davi Santos, and their teenage daughter Lia. Defectors. Seeking asylum. Scheduled for processing tomorrow at 14:20.

"Will it work?" Amara asked in barely-accented English. "Will they grant us asylum?"

"Your cases are strong," Yuki said gently. "You're fleeing persecution, seeking freedom of thought. Chronos accepts such claims."

"But we left illegally. No exit visas. No approved documents." Davi wrung his hands. "What if they send us back?"

"They won't." Yuki hoped her certainty sounded more genuine than she felt. "Tomorrow, during the parliamentary session, border processing will be minimal. You'll cross at 14:20, claim asylum, and by the time the session ends, you'll be official residents."

"You've arranged this?" Lia asked. At sixteen, she was sharp enough to see the coordination.

"I've... facilitated it," Yuki admitted. "The resistance coordinates these extractions. Tomorrow is special—multiple operations, maximum chaos, minimal oversight."

"Elena's operation," Amara said. She'd been in the same correction facility briefly. She knew the players.

"Yes. Elena's operation."

After the family left, Yuki meditated in her private room. Tomorrow would bring harm—the defectors fleeing brought pain to families left behind, the sanctions would hurt innocent Veridican citizens. But tomorrow would also bring healing—freedom for the oppressed, pressure for reform, hope for change.

"First, do no harm," she whispered. "But sometimes, harm is necessary for healing."

Her comm device chimed. Elena's message:

**TOMORROW 14:20, THREE DEFECTORS CROSS. MAKE SURE PROCESSING IS SMOOTH. THIS IS IMPORTANT, YUKI. THESE PEOPLE MATTER. - E**

Yuki replied: **THEY WILL BE SAFE. I PROMISE. - Y**

She returned to her meditation. Tomorrow at 14:30, she would testify before parliament. Tomorrow at 14:20, three people would become free. Tomorrow, everything would change.

She was ready.

### Alexei and Dmitri - Resistance Mobile Command

The mobile command center sat in neutral territory, fifty kilometers from the Veridica border. Inside, Alexei and Dmitri Volkov reviewed the operation plan on brass-edged screens while Elena coordinated from across the room.

"Twelve facilities," Dmitri said, studying the tactical map. "Forty-eight inmates total. Sixteen extraction teams. One-hour window."

"We've been planning this for two months," Alexei replied. "Every team knows their assignment. Every escape route is mapped. Every contingency has a contingency."

"It's still the biggest operation we've ever attempted." Dmitri's enforcer training made him cautious. "If one team fails, it could compromise the others. If authorities respond quickly—"

"They won't." Elena joined them, her presence commanding immediate attention. "Tomorrow between 14:00 and 15:00, Veridica's security systems will be... distracted. Multiple simultaneous events. Parliament in Chronos voting on sanctions. Border security stretched thin. And something else—I don't know what, but Nikolai says there's unusual traffic in the factorepo systems."

"What kind of traffic?" Dmitri asked.

"He wouldn't say. Just told me to be ready for chaos." Elena pulled up the extraction schedule. "Our operation runs 14:25 to 14:55. Thirty-minute execution window within the hour of chaos. We extract all forty-eight inmates, disperse to safe houses, and disappear before anyone knows what happened."

Alexei grinned. "I love it when a plan comes together."

"The plan hasn't come together yet," Dmitri said. "Tomorrow, it either works perfectly or fails catastrophically. There's no middle ground with an operation this size."

"That's what makes it exciting," Alexei said.

"That's what makes it terrifying," Dmitri countered.

They clasped hands—the same gesture they'd shared in the correction facility. Two brothers who'd been separated by ideology, reunited by resistance, now leading the largest coordinated extraction in the movement's history.

"For family," Alexei said.

"For truth," Dmitri added.

"For freedom," they finished together.

Elena watched them with something like pride. Then her expression darkened. "I have a bad feeling about tomorrow."

Both brothers stared at her. Elena never admitted doubt.

"What kind of bad feeling?" Dmitri asked.

"The kind that says we're not the only ones planning something. The kind that says someone else is using tomorrow's chaos for their own purposes." Elena pulled up a classified intelligence report. "Three months ago, a senior factorepo architect named Thomas Wei started exhibiting unusual behavior. Accessing systems outside his clearance. Meeting with unauthorized parties. Acting nervous."

"You think he's a threat to the operation?"

"I think he's planning something. I don't know what. But his unusual activity peaks tomorrow between 14:00 and 15:00." Elena closed the file. "Stay alert. If something seems wrong, abort and extract. The inmates matter more than the operation."

"Understood," both brothers said.

After Elena left, Alexei and Dmitri sat in silence.

"Tomorrow," Alexei finally said, "we change everything."

"Or tomorrow," Dmitri replied, "everything changes us."

They didn't sleep much that night. Tomorrow felt too big.

### Nikolai - Underground Network Hub

Nikolai Volkov sat surrounded by servers and screens in his hidden bunker beneath Veridica's industrial district. To the world above, he was a low-level factorepo technician. To the resistance, he was their eyes and ears inside the system.

Tomorrow at 14:00, he would monitor everything.

His screens showed a dozen simultaneous operations: Elena's extractions, Marcus and Kira's evidence upload, Isaiah's border crossing, Dr. Tanaka's defector processing. All coordinated for the same one-hour window. All depending on him to provide early warning if something went wrong.

But something was already wrong.

Nikolai had been tracking anomalous activity in the factorepo systems for weeks. Someone was preparing something. Unusual code insertions. Strange access patterns. Encrypted packages hidden in system files.

The activity centered around Thomas Wei, a senior architect Nikolai had never heard of before. Wei had clearance for deep system access, but his recent behavior suggested something beyond normal operations.

Nikolai pulled up Wei's activity log. The pattern was clear: Wei was building something. A program. A protocol. Something designed to activate tomorrow between 14:00 and 15:00.

The same window as everyone else's operations.

Nikolai's hands flew across his keyboards. He isolated Wei's code, attempted to analyze it, hit encryption he couldn't immediately break. Whatever Wei was doing, he'd hidden it well.

Too well.

Nikolai sent urgent messages to Marcus, Elena, Isaiah, and Dr. Tanaka:

**UNUSUAL ACTIVITY DETECTED IN FACTOREPO SYSTEMS. SOMEONE NAMED THOMAS WEI IS PLANNING SOMETHING FOR 14:00-15:00 TOMORROW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT. STAY ALERT. IF ANYTHING SEEMS WRONG, ABORT YOUR OPERATIONS. I'LL MONITOR FROM HERE. - N**

Then he returned to his analysis. He had sixteen hours to figure out what Wei was doing.

Sixteen hours to prevent something he didn't understand.

Sixteen hours before tomorrow's chaos began.

He didn't sleep. He coded, analyzed, searched, and worried.

Tomorrow at 14:00, multiple operations would collide. And Nikolai had a terrible feeling that not all of them would succeed.

### Thomas Wei - Government Factorepo Headquarters

Thomas Wei sat in his private office on the 40th floor of the factorepo headquarters, reviewing his plan one final time. Everything had to be perfect. Everything had to execute exactly on schedule.

Tomorrow at 14:00, he would activate the erasure protocol.

Tomorrow at 14:23, he would kill Minister Viktor Kozlov.

Tomorrow at 15:00, the erasure would complete, and one hour of history would be gone forever.

The plan was elegant in its simplicity. Kozlov had scheduled a meeting with Marcus Chen—the outlaw reformer who'd escaped the correction facility. Kozlov was going to expose the correction system, the fact storm weapons program, everything. His conscience had finally caught up with him.

Wei couldn't allow that. The programs were too important. The research too valuable. The Architects had plans that required secrecy.

So Kozlov would die during the lost hour, and no factorepo record would exist to prove when or how. The outlaws' operations—Wei had intercepted communications, knew about the extractions, the uploads, the border crossings—would provide perfect cover. Chaos and confusion. Multiple suspects. No clear timeline.

And with the factorepo data erased, no evidence would exist to contradict Wei's eventual explanation: that one of the outlaws had killed Kozlov during their operations.

Probably Marcus Chen. The perfect patsy—a known outlaw with motive, who would be near Kozlov's office during the lost hour for the evidence upload.

Wei reviewed the erasure code one final time. He'd been building it for months, hidden in legitimate system updates. Tomorrow at 14:00, it would activate automatically. The factorepo's backup systems would fail sequentially. The data for one hour—14:00 to 15:00—would be corrupted beyond recovery.

By 15:01, that hour would be lost forever.

And Kozlov would be dead.

And the outlaws would be suspects.

And The Architects' programs would remain secret.

Perfect.

Wei allowed himself a rare smile. Tomorrow, he would commit the perfect crime. Tomorrow, he would erase an hour of history. Tomorrow, he would prove that even the Histologic system could be beaten by someone clever enough, ruthless enough, patient enough.

He sent a message to his contact:

**TOMORROW 14:00, PROTOCOL ACTIVATES. 14:23, TARGET ELIMINATED. 15:00, ERASURE COMPLETE. EVERYTHING IS READY. - W**

The reply came immediately:

**EXCELLENT. THE ARCHITECTS WILL BE PLEASED. PROCEED AS PLANNED. LEAVE NO WITNESSES. - SYNTHESIS**

Wei deleted both messages, stood, and looked out at the city. Tomorrow, Veridica would wake to chaos. Tomorrow, an hour would be lost. Tomorrow, history would change.

And Thomas Wei would ensure that particular history was never recorded.

He went home to sleep. Tomorrow required a clear mind.

### Viktor Kozlov - Minister's Residence

Minister Viktor Kozlov sat in his study, writing a letter he would never send. His hands shook as he wrote—not from fear, but from age and exhaustion.

He'd served Veridica for forty years. He'd helped build the correction system. He'd approved the fact storm weapons research. He'd looked the other way when The Architects had asked him to.

And now, at sixty-two, his conscience had finally caught up with him.

Tomorrow at 14:30, he was scheduled to meet with Marcus Chen. The young man who'd been wrongly convicted, who'd escaped, who'd been gathering evidence of systematic corruption. Kozlov had arranged the meeting through intermediaries, had promised to provide testimony, had agreed to expose everything.

Tomorrow, he would tell the truth. Tomorrow, he would redeem himself. Tomorrow, he would atone for forty years of complicity.

If he lived that long.

Kozlov wasn't naive. He knew The Architects wouldn't let him testify freely. He knew there would be consequences for his betrayal. He'd taken precautions—written documents hidden in multiple locations, dead man's switches that would release information if he died unexpectedly, allies who would ensure the truth emerged even if he didn't survive.

But tomorrow felt different. Tomorrow felt final.

He finished the letter—a confession, an apology, an explanation—and sealed it in an envelope marked: *To be opened if I die before reform succeeds.*

He gave the letter to his most trusted aide with instructions: "If anything happens to me tomorrow, deliver this to Marcus Chen. Make sure he knows the truth. Make sure my death means something."

The aide, a young woman named Maya, took the letter with trembling hands. "Minister, are you in danger?"

"We're all in danger, Maya. We have been for years. We just didn't notice." Kozlov smiled sadly. "Tomorrow, I'm going to do the right thing. Finally. After forty years of doing the expedient thing, the political thing, the comfortable thing. Tomorrow, I choose truth."

"Sir—"

"Go home, Maya. Tomorrow will be chaotic. Stay safe."

After she left, Kozlov sat alone in his study, thinking about tomorrow. About redemption and consequences. About truth and lies. About the life he'd lived and the death he might die.

Tomorrow at 14:30, he would tell Marcus Chen everything. Tomorrow, he would expose The Architects. Tomorrow, he would prove that even corrupted men could choose truth in the end.

If The Architects let him live that long.

Kozlov checked his chronometer: 23:47. In less than fifteen hours, everything would change.

He hoped he'd be alive to see it.

## November 15, 2106 - 00:01

Across Veridica and beyond, people slept or didn't sleep, prepared or didn't prepare, worried or didn't worry about tomorrow.

At 00:01, tomorrow became today.

The clock ticked forward.

Fourteen hours until chaos.

Fourteen hours until history.

Fourteen hours until the lost hour began.
