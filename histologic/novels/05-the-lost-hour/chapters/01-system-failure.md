# Chapter 1: System Failure

## POV: Maya Reeves

## November 15, 2106 - 15:01

The alarms started

 exactly one minute after three.

Maya Reeves had been a factorepo systems technician for two years, and she'd never heard this particular alarm. It wasn't the standard warning chime for processing delays or the urgent beep of unauthorized access. This was different—a deep, rhythmic pulse that vibrated through the brass pipes in the walls, through the copper flooring, through her chest.

Something fundamental had broken.

"Status!" Director Yuri Petrov barked from his office, emerging like a storm. "What's that alarm?"

Maya's fingers flew across her keyboards. Three screens showed cascading errors, red warnings multiplying faster than she could read them. The factorepo's monitoring suite—normally a calm green display of synchronized systems—looked like a battlefield.

"Director, I'm showing... I don't understand this." She pulled up the integrity check. "The primary factorepo is reporting data loss. Significant data loss."

"How significant?" Petrov loomed over her shoulder.

"I..." Maya ran the diagnostic again. The number hadn't changed. "Sixty minutes, sir. From 14:00 to 15:00 today. The data is just... gone."

"That's impossible. The factorepo doesn't lose data. We have triple redundancy, continuous backup, distributed storage across eight facilities—"

"I know, sir. But look." Maya brought up the data verification log. "At 14:00, all systems showed normal. At 15:00, the integrity check ran automatically. That's when it detected the loss. One hour. Completely gone."

Petrov stared at the screen, his face draining of color. "Pull up the backup systems."

Maya was already typing. "Backup One... also missing the hour. Backup Two... same. Backup Three—"

"All of them?"

"All of them, sir." Maya's hands were shaking. "It's like that hour never existed. Like it was... erased."

"Data doesn't just disappear. Check the archive servers. Check the distributed nodes. Check—"

"Sir." Maya interrupted him, which she'd never done before. "I've checked. All storage systems. All backup protocols. All distributed archives. The data for 14:00 to 15:00 today is missing from every single repository."

Petrov gripped the back of her chair. "That's not possible. That would require... that would require deliberate action. Coordinated deletion across multiple redundant systems. Someone would have to—"

"Sir." Another technician, Jakob, called out from across the room. "I'm showing anomalous code in the backup sync protocol. Encrypted insertion. It looks like..." He went pale. "It looks like a deletion script. Activated at 14:00, executed sequentially across all backup systems."

"Who inserted it?" Petrov demanded.

"I can't tell yet. The code's heavily encrypted. But sir, this wasn't random. This wasn't a malfunction. Someone deliberately erased that hour."

The room fell silent except for the pulsing alarm.

Maya stared at her screen, at the empty space where an hour of history should be. In a Histologic nation, the factorepo was truth. It was law. It was the foundation of everything. And someone had just erased an hour of it.

"Director," she said quietly. "Without that hour, The Judge can't verify what happened during it. Legally, anything that occurred between 14:00 and 15:00 today... didn't happen."

Petrov's jaw tightened. "Contact central security. Contact The Judge's operations center. And..." He paused, seeming to age ten years in a moment. "Contact Minister Kozlov. He needs to know about this immediately."

"Sir, I tried calling the Minister's office at 14:30 for routine approval on a systems update. He didn't answer."

"Try again."

Maya dialed the Minister's private line. It rang six times before switching to an automated message: *"Minister Viktor Kozlov is unavailable. Please leave a message or contact his administrative office."*

"He's not answering, sir."

"Then call his aide. Call his security detail. Call—"

Jakob interrupted: "Director, I'm receiving an emergency alert from the Executive Building. Security is requesting immediate response to Minister Kozlov's office. Code Black."

Code Black. Reserved for assassination, terrorism, or catastrophic security breach.

Petrov and Maya exchanged looks.

"What floor is his office?" Maya asked, though she already knew.

"Fortieth," Petrov said. "Why?"

"Because this building's systems showed unusual activity on the fortieth floor at..." Maya checked her logs. "At 14:23. Exactly thirty-seven minutes before the hour ended. Exactly thirty-seven minutes inside the lost hour."

---

Petrov left immediately for the Executive Building, taking Maya with him. They rode the brass elevator in silence, surrounded by mirrored walls that reflected their worried faces infinitely.

When the doors opened on the fortieth floor, they found chaos.

Security enforcers filled the hallway. Crime scene equipment—brass cameras on tripods, copper evidence collection kits, sensor arrays—surrounded the Minister's office. Through the open door, Maya could see a body slumped over a desk.

Captain Yevgenia Sokolov stood in the hallway, directing her team with sharp efficiency. She'd been promoted from border guard to central security after—Maya remembered—after helping with something at the correction facility. She had the bearing of someone who'd seen violence but refused to be hardened by it.

"Director Petrov," Sokolov acknowledged. "You shouldn't be here. This is an active crime scene."

"Captain, I need to know: when did this happen?"

"We're not certain. Minister Kozlov's aide found him at 15:05. We estimate time of death somewhere between—" She checked her notes. "Between 14:00 and 15:00."

"The lost hour," Maya whispered.

Sokolov's sharp eyes fixed on her. "Excuse me?"

Petrov explained: "The factorepo has suffered a catastrophic failure. Data for 14:00 to 15:00 today has been completely erased. We have no record of what happened during that hour."

Sokolov's expression hardened. "None at all?"

"None. Not from primary storage, not from backups, not from distributed archives. That hour is... lost."

"Then we can't determine time of death precisely," Sokolov said. "We can't access surveillance footage. We can't verify anyone's locations. We can't—" She stopped, understanding dawning. "We can't solve this murder using The Judge. We'll have to investigate the old way."

"With human testimony and physical evidence," Petrov confirmed.

"In a Histologic nation." Sokolov's laugh was bitter. "We base our entire legal system on factorepo records. Without them, how do we even conduct a trial?"

Maya had been studying the hallway while they talked. The brass fixtures. The copper trim. The cameras mounted every ten meters. Standard government building security—everything recorded, everything logged, everything stored in the factorepo.

Except for one hour. One very convenient hour.

"Captain," Maya said carefully. "Was Minister Kozlov planning anything important today? Any meetings, any announcements?"

Sokolov consulted her tablet. "His official schedule shows a meeting at 14:30. No details about who or why—it was marked private."

"Do you know if he kept that meeting?"

"How could I know? The factorepo—"

"—is missing that hour," Maya finished. "Exactly. Very convenient timing."

Sokolov's eyes narrowed. "Are you suggesting someone deliberately erased the factorepo to cover up this murder?"

"I'm suggesting," Maya said, "that erasing an hour of history requires serious technical skill and high-level access. And that murdering a government minister requires serious motive and opportunity. And that both happening at the same time is too coincidental to be coincidence."

Petrov placed a warning hand on her shoulder. "Maya, we don't speculate—"

"Sir, with respect, speculation is all we have. We can't check facts. We can't verify timestamps. We can't prove what happened. Someone erased our ability to know truth." Maya felt anger rising in her chest—not at the murder, though that was terrible, but at the erasure. At the deliberate destruction of history itself. "Whoever did this didn't just kill Minister Kozlov. They killed an hour of everyone's history. They made it so nothing that happened then can be proven. That's not just murder. That's historical assassination."

Sokolov studied Maya with new respect. "You're the technician who discovered the loss?"

"Yes, Captain."

"Then I'm officially recruiting you to this investigation. We need someone who understands the technical side." Sokolov pulled out a brass badge. "As of now, you're working directly for central security. Report to me immediately if you discover anything about how the erasure was accomplished or who might have done it."

Maya took the badge. It was heavier than she expected.

"Director Petrov, I'll need access to all your systems logs, all personnel records, and all security clearances for anyone who could have inserted that deletion code."

"You'll have it within the hour."

"And one more thing." Sokolov's expression darkened. "I need a list of anyone who might have wanted Minister Kozlov dead. Anyone with motive, access, and technical capability."

"That's a short list," Petrov said. "Very few people have deep system access."

"Then it should be easy to investigate." Sokolov turned back to the crime scene. "Except we're investigating a murder that technically didn't happen, during an hour that technically doesn't exist. In a nation that bases its entire legal system on the idea that everything is recorded and nothing is uncertain."

Maya looked through the door at Kozlov's body. Even from here, she could see the precision of it—single gunshot, execution style, no struggle. Professional. Planned. Timed perfectly to occur during an hour that would be erased.

"Captain," she said quietly. "Whoever did this... they didn't just understand our technical systems. They understood our legal system. They knew that without factorepo records, we couldn't prosecute them normally. They weaponized our own certainty against us."

"Then we'll have to find a new way to pursue justice." Sokolov's voice was steel. "Because I don't care if that hour is lost forever—someone committed murder, and they will answer for it."

---

Maya spent the next three hours in the factorepo operations center, analyzing the deletion code with Jakob and two other senior technicians. What they found was disturbing.

The code was elegant. Sophisticated. Written by someone who understood the factorepo architecture intimately. It had been inserted into the backup sync protocol over three months—tiny fragments hidden in legitimate system updates, undetectable individually, only dangerous when assembled.

At exactly 14:00 today, the fragments had activated and assembled into a complete program. The program had systematically corrupted data across all backup systems, working from newest to oldest, ensuring that by 15:00, all trace of the hour would be gone.

"It's beautiful," Jakob said with reluctant admiration. "Horrible, but beautiful. Whoever wrote this is a master of distributed systems."

"Can you identify the author?" Maya asked.

"The code style... it reminds me of someone." Jakob pulled up comparison files. "See these function names? This optimization pattern? This approach to error handling? I've seen this before in internal code reviews."

"Whose code?"

Jakob highlighted a name in the review logs: **Thomas Wei, Senior Systems Architect.**

Maya's blood went cold. "Thomas Wei. What's his clearance level?"

"Highest administrative tier. He has access to everything—backup systems, sync protocols, distributed archives. If anyone could insert this code undetected, it would be him."

"Where is Wei now?"

Jakob checked the personnel logs. "According to his badge, he's here. In the building. He checked in at 14:55, five minutes before the end of the hour. He's been in Conference Room 12-B since then."

"Doing what?"

"Leading the investigation into the factorepo failure."

Maya and Jakob stared at each other.

"The fox guarding the henhouse," Maya said.

"We need to tell Captain Sokolov."

"Not yet. We need to be certain. If Wei is behind this—if he murdered Kozlov and erased the hour—he's smart enough to have covered his tracks. We accuse him without solid evidence, and he'll destroy what little proof we have."

"Then what do we do?"

Maya thought for a moment. "We watch him. We analyze his every move. We trace every line of code he's touched. And we find proof that he's our killer before he realizes we suspect him."

"Maya, this is dangerous. If Wei killed a Minister—"

"Then he won't hesitate to kill us if we get too close." Maya's hands were shaking, but her voice was steady. "Which is why we need to be smart. We need to be careful. And we need to be faster than he is."

Her comm device buzzed. Message from an unknown sender:

**YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT WEI. BUT YOU'RE WRONG TO INVESTIGATE ALONE. THERE ARE OTHERS LOOKING FOR THE TRUTH. WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER. MEET ME AT THE COPPER ARCHIVES, MIDNIGHT. COME ALONE. - A FRIEND**

Maya deleted the message immediately, her heart racing. Someone was watching her. Someone knew she suspected Wei.

Friend or foe? Ally or trap?

Only one way to find out.

At 23:45, Maya stood outside the Copper Archives—a vast library of physical records kept as backup to the digital factorepo. The building was dark except for a few brass lamps illuminating the entrance.

She'd told no one she was coming. If this was a trap, no one would know to look for her.

The door opened. A young woman stepped out—petite, sharp-eyed, with callused fingers and an air of careful competence.

"Maya Reeves?" the woman asked.

"Yes. And you are?"

"Someone who wants to find the truth as much as you do. Come inside. We have a lot to discuss."

Maya followed her into the archives. In a reading room lit by copper lanterns, six other people waited.

She recognized two of them from their infamous photos: Marcus Chen and Kira Osman. The escaped correction facility inmates. The outlaws. The reformers.

"Thank you for coming," Marcus said. "We know this is dangerous. We know you're taking a risk. But we need your help, and you need ours."

"Why should I trust you?" Maya asked. "You're convicted outlaws."

"Convicted of seeking truth," Kira said. "Just like you're doing now. We didn't murder Minister Kozlov. But someone did. And that same someone erased the hour to cover it up. We want to prove who."

"Why?"

"Because we were also operating during the lost hour," Marcus admitted. "We were uploading evidence of government corruption. Evidence that's now erased. If we don't prove Wei killed Kozlov, we'll be blamed for it. The perfect patsies—outlaws who were near the scene during the lost hour."

"How do you know Wei is the killer?"

Kira pulled up a screen. "Because we've been tracking him for months. We knew he was planning something. We just didn't know what. Now we do: he killed Kozlov to prevent him from exposing The Architects' programs. And he erased the hour to eliminate evidence."

"Can you prove it?"

"Not without your help. We can't access the factorepo systems. But you can." Kira's eyes held steady on Maya's. "You're the one who discovered the loss. You're the one investigating the deletion code. You're the one with access to logs that might prove Wei's guilt. We need you to find that proof."

"And if I help you? If I prove Wei is guilty? What happens to you?"

"We'll be cleared," Marcus said. "And more importantly, the truth will be known. Kozlov will get justice. And everyone else who acted during the lost hour—for good reasons or bad—will be judged accurately."

Maya thought about it. Thought about Kozlov dead at his desk. Thought about an hour of history erased. Thought about justice that depended on facts that no longer existed.

"Tell me everything you know about Wei," she said. "Tell me about the lost hour. Tell me about everyone who was operating during it. Because if we're going to solve this murder, we need to reconstruct that entire hour from memory, testimony, and whatever fragments of evidence survived."

Marcus smiled. "Then we should get started. We have sixty minutes to reconstruct. And very little time before Wei realizes we're investigating him."

Kira opened her laptop. "I've been collecting data since the moment the hour ended. Partial fragments. Incomplete logs. Human testimony. It's not much. But it's a start."

Maya sat down with the outlaws, the reformers, the people her government had condemned.

Together, they began to rebuild a lost hour.
