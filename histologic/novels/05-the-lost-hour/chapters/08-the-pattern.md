# Chapter 8: The Pattern

## POV: Kira Osman

## November 15, 2106 - 20:00

Kira crouched in the maintenance tunnels beneath Veridica's industrial district, her laptop connected to a junction box that gave her access to the city's data infrastructure. Not official access—she'd spliced into the lines using techniques Nikolai had taught her—but access nonetheless.

Above her, enforcers were still searching for her. She'd escaped the safe house raid through a hidden exit she'd installed months ago, knowing eventually they'd come. Now she needed to stay hidden while gathering evidence to clear Marcus.

And she needed to do it before someone—probably Wei—decided she was a loose end worth eliminating.

Her screen displayed cascading data: system logs, access records, deletion patterns. She was hunting for proof that Thomas Wei had orchestrated the erasure. Proof that would hold up without factorepo verification.

Because in a world where the hour was lost, traditional evidence wouldn't work. She needed something undeniable. Something Wei couldn't have erased even if he tried.

She pulled up the deletion code that Maya had identified. Jakob had been right—the signature was elegant, sophisticated, clearly Wei's work. But signatures could be forged. She needed more.

Kira began analyzing the code's insertion pattern. When was each fragment added? Which updates contained them? Who approved those updates?

The fragments had been inserted over three months, hidden in legitimate system patches. Each insertion coincided with updates Wei had personally approved. Each fragment was small enough to avoid automated detection.

But the pattern of insertion told a story.

*Fragment 1: August 20, 2106* - Basic deletion framework
*Fragment 2: September 5, 2106* - Backup targeting module  
*Fragment 3: September 23, 2106* - Sequential corruption engine
*Fragment 4: October 12, 2106* - Activation trigger
*Fragment 5: November 1, 2106* - Final assembly script

Someone planning methodically. Building a weapon slowly. Timing it perfectly.

But more importantly: the earliest fragment was inserted August 20. Two weeks after the correction facility escape. Which meant Wei had started planning the erasure before anyone knew about the lost hour operations. Before Elena had coordinated the timing. Before the resistance had scheduled extractions.

He wasn't just using the chaos as cover. He'd anticipated it. Or helped create it.

Kira pulled up another set of logs: Wei's communication records. Heavily encrypted, but not impossible to crack. She set her decryption algorithms running while she analyzed what she could see.

Wei had been communicating with someone outside official channels. Someone using the identifier "SYNTHESIS." The messages were encrypted, but the metadata told a story: regular contact over six months, increasing frequency in the weeks before the lost hour.

SYNTHESIS wasn't a Veridican ID. It was external. Possibly SFW. Possibly CNT. Possibly something else entirely.

Kira's decryption algorithms broke through the first layer of encryption. Partial message recovered:

*"...TARGET CONFIRMED... KOZLOV PREPARING TO EXPOSE... CANNOT ALLOW TESTIMONY... RECOMMEND ELIMINATION DURING CHAOS WINDOW... ERASURE PROTOCOL READY..."*

Her hands went cold. Wei hadn't just murdered Kozlov opportunistically. He'd planned it. Coordinated it with someone external. Used the resistance operations as deliberate cover.

Which meant...

Kira pulled up Elena's communication logs. The resistance leader was careful, but Kira knew her patterns. She found what she was looking for: an encrypted exchange from October, discussing the November 15 timing.

But the encryption had been broken. Recently. Within the past week.

Someone had intercepted Elena's communications. Someone had known about the November 15 operations in advance. Someone had used that knowledge to plan a murder.

Wei.

Or whoever was controlling Wei.

Kira dove deeper into the communications intercepts. Wei had accessed multiple encrypted channels over the past months: Elena's resistance network, Isaiah's journalistic contacts, Dr. Tanaka's defector coordination, even Marcus and Kira's operational planning.

He'd been monitoring everyone. Watching their plans develop. Waiting for the perfect moment.

And then he'd inserted himself into their timeline. Used their operations as cover. Killed Kozlov during the chaos. Erased the evidence. And positioned himself to investigate his own crime.

It was brilliant. It was horrifying. It was exactly what Kira would have done if she were a monster.

But Wei had made mistakes. He'd left traces. Communication metadata. Access logs. Insertion patterns. The kind of digital breadcrumbs that someone like Kira could follow.

She compiled everything into a single file: the deletion code signature, the insertion timeline, the communication intercepts, the metadata patterns. It wasn't complete proof—too much was encrypted or circumstantial—but it was a strong case.

Strong enough to shift suspicion from Marcus to Wei. Strong enough to justify deeper investigation. Strong enough to save Marcus's life.

Kira encrypted the file and sent copies to three people: Captain Sokolov, Maya Reeves, and Nikolai Volkov. If something happened to her, if Wei found her, if she didn't survive the night—the evidence would survive.

Then she began writing a second document: her testimony. Everything she'd witnessed during the lost hour. Everything she'd discovered since. Everything that proved Marcus was innocent and Wei was guilty.

She wrote for an hour, documenting every detail, every timestamp, every observation. Creating a record from memory that would survive even if digital evidence disappeared.

At 21:00, her comm device buzzed. Message from Maya:

**KIRA - RECEIVED YOUR FILE. IT'S EXPLOSIVE. WEI IS DEFINITELY INVOLVED. BUT I NEED MORE. SOMETHING THAT PROVES HE WAS PHYSICALLY AT KOZLOV'S OFFICE DURING THE LOST HOUR. SECURITY BADGE LOGS, PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, WITNESS TESTIMONY. CAN YOU FIND ANYTHING? - M**

Kira pulled up the Executive Building's security systems. Badge access logs had been erased along with the rest of the hour's data. But...

She smiled.

The Executive Building used physical brass badges with embedded chips. The chips logged access electronically—those logs were erased. But the badges themselves recorded access mechanically as well, as a backup in case electronic systems failed.

It was an old-fashioned failsafe, a redundancy most people had forgotten about.

Mechanical logs that weren't connected to the factorepo. Mechanical logs that couldn't be digitally erased. Mechanical logs that would show who accessed the fortieth floor during the lost hour.

If she could get to Wei's badge, she could prove he'd been at Kozlov's office.

Kira sent a reply:

**MAYA - BADGE LOGS. MECHANICAL BACKUP. NEED TO ACCESS WEI'S PHYSICAL BADGE. IT WILL SHOW HIS MOVEMENTS DURING LOST HOUR. CAN YOU GET IT? - K**

The response came quickly:

**TOO RISKY. HE KEEPS IT ON HIM. BUT THERE'S A CENTRAL LOG AT SECURITY HEADQUARTERS. MECHANICAL READER THAT BACKS UP ALL BADGE ACCESS. NOT CONNECTED TO FACTOREPO. MIGHT STILL HAVE THE HOUR'S DATA. MEET ME THERE AT MIDNIGHT? - M**

Kira checked the time: 21:15. Two hours and forty-five minutes.

She sent her response:

**I'LL BE THERE. COME ALONE. - K**

Then she gathered her equipment and prepared to move. Security Headquarters was across the city, through enforcer patrols and surveillance networks. Getting there unseen would be challenging.

But she'd escaped a correction facility. She'd evaded a safe house raid. She could manage one more covert operation.

For Marcus. For truth. For the chance to prove that Wei was a murderer.

At 23:45, Kira approached Security Headquarters from the maintenance tunnels. The building sat in the government quarter, all brass and authority. Normally, approaching it would be suicide for a wanted fugitive.

But tonight, the security was focused on external threats. No one expected someone to infiltrate from below.

Kira used her technical skills to bypass tunnel access controls, ascending through maintenance shafts to a storage area on the second floor. Maya had provided the route—she'd studied the building's layout and identified the least monitored approach.

At 23:58, Kira emerged in a storage room filled with old equipment and archived materials. She waited, listening, ensuring she was alone.

At midnight exactly, the door opened. Maya Reeves entered, carrying a brass toolkit.

"You made it," Maya whispered.

"As promised. The central log?"

"This way. Third floor, archives section. The mechanical reader is in a vault that's supposed to be sealed, but I have override codes."

They moved through darkened hallways, avoiding cameras and patrols. Maya navigated with the confidence of someone who'd studied the security patterns thoroughly.

The archives vault was protected by a brass door with mechanical locks. Maya worked the combination—numbers provided by Director Petrov, who suspected Wei but couldn't prove it—and the door swung open.

Inside: rows of brass filing cabinets and, in the center, a mechanical badge reader. The device was beautiful in its simplicity—brass gears and copper contacts, recording badge access through physical impressions on wax cylinders.

Technology from before the digital age, maintained as backup, forgotten by most.

"Each badge leaves a unique impression," Maya explained, pulling up the cylinder for November 15. "Depth, pattern, timing—all recorded mechanically. We find Wei's badge impression during the lost hour, we prove he was at the Executive Building."

Kira examined the cylinder. Hundreds of impressions, each stamped with timestamp and location data. She found the fortieth floor section and began analyzing.

14:00 - Executive cleaning staff
14:05 - Security patrol
14:10 - Nothing
14:15 - Nothing
14:20 - Unknown badge, senior admin clearance
14:23 - Same badge, fortieth floor access
14:30 - Nothing
14:35 - Nothing

"There," Kira pointed. "14:23. Someone with senior admin clearance accessed the fortieth floor. Three minutes before the gunshot Dmitri heard."

Maya pulled out a reference guide. "We can identify the badge by its impression pattern. Each one is unique."

She compared the 14:23 impression against the catalog. It took five minutes of careful comparison, but finally she found it.

"Badge Alpha-7," Maya read. "Assigned to... Thomas Wei."

They stared at each other.

"We have him," Kira said. "Physical evidence that can't be digitally erased. Mechanical proof that Wei was at Kozlov's office during the lost hour."

"This is enough to arrest him. To charge him. To prove Marcus is innocent."

Kira photographed the cylinder from multiple angles, documenting the evidence. Then she used her tools to carefully extract the cylinder section containing Wei's impression—physical proof they could present in court.

"Captain Sokolov needs to see this," Maya said.

"Now. Tonight. Before Wei realizes we have it."

They secured the evidence and began moving back toward the exits. But as they descended the stairs, alarms began sounding.

Not the building's alarms. Kira's early warning system—a network of sensors she'd placed throughout the city to detect enforcer movements.

Someone was coming. Multiple units. Moving fast.

"Wei knows we're here," Kira said. "He must have surveillance on this building."

"Then we run."

They ran.
