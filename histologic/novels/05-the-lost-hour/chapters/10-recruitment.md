# Chapter 10: Recruitment

## POV: Kira Osman

## November 16, 2106 - 18:00

Captain Sokolov's office was spare and functional—brass desk, copper filing cabinets, a single window overlooking Veridica's government quarter. No personal touches. No photographs. Everything official, professional, carefully neutral.

Except for the old-world map on the wall. Faded, pre-Histologic, showing borders that no longer existed and nations that had been reorganized. A reminder of chaos that had been replaced by order.

Or so the official story claimed.

"You wanted to see me?" Kira asked from the doorway.

Sokolov looked up from her terminal. "Kira Osman. Wanted for unauthorized factorepo access, conspiracy with escaped correction facility inmates, and evading enforcement. Should I arrest you now or hear what you have to say first?"

"I'd prefer the latter."

"So would I." Sokolov gestured to a chair. "Sit. We need to talk about the investigation."

Kira sat warily, ready to bolt if this was a trap. "What about it?"

"It's being corrupted. Evidence is disappearing. Witnesses are being intimidated. And Thomas Wei is controlling the narrative." Sokolov leaned back. "I'm trying to build a legitimate case, but I'm being undermined by the person I'm supposed to be investigating. It's professionally frustrating and ethically intolerable."

"So arrest him."

"On what evidence? Everything in the factorepo was erased. Physical evidence is circumstantial. Witness testimony is scattered and incomplete. The Judge can't issue a conviction without certainty, and Wei ensured certainty was deleted."

"Then use human judgment. Testimonial evidence. The old way."

"The court won't accept that. Not without precedent. Not without philosophical framework. Not without someone making the case that human testimony is legally sufficient." Sokolov met her eyes. "Someone like you."

Kira blinked. "Me?"

"You're a resistance intelligence analyst. You've specialized in reconstructing truth from partial data. You understand both factorepo systems and human networks. And you're motivated to prove Marcus Chen's innocence."

"You want me to join the investigation? Officially?"

"I want you to consult. Provide technical analysis. Help build a case based on testimony, pattern recognition, and logical reconstruction." Sokolov pulled up a document. "Temporary investigative consultant. Pardoned for previous charges in exchange for cooperation. Effective immediately if you accept."

Kira's mind raced. This was an opportunity—access to official resources, legal protection, the chance to help Marcus. But it was also dangerous. Working within the system meant following its rules, accepting its limitations.

"What's the catch?" she asked.

"The catch is you have to actually build a legitimate case. No fabricating evidence. No coercing witnesses. No vigilante justice. You work within the law, or you're back to being a fugitive."

"What if the law is insufficient? What if working within the system means accepting its corruption?"

"Then you change the system legally. You establish precedent. You make the philosophical argument. You convince courts and judges and officials that reform is necessary." Sokolov's expression softened slightly. "I know you don't trust the system, Kira. I don't blame you. But burning it down doesn't help people like Marcus who are trapped inside it. Reforming it does."

Kira thought about the Foundation fragment. About Viktor Kozlov dying to expose systematic corruption. About Marcus facing conviction for a crime he didn't commit.

"If I accept," she said carefully, "I need freedom to investigate what I think is relevant. Including things that might implicate more than just Wei."

"Such as?"

"Such as The Architects. Such as classified programs Kozlov discovered. Such as..." Kira pulled out the Foundation fragment. "Such as this."

She laid the yellowed page on Sokolov's desk.

The captain read it slowly, her expression shifting from curiosity to shock to grim understanding.

"Where did you get this?" Sokolov asked quietly.

"Viktor Kozlov's widow. He found it before he died. It's a fragment of a larger document—a philosophical framework for Histologic written before the system was implemented. It suggests the entire system was designed to manipulate truth, not preserve it."

"That's... that's alleging a conspiracy at the foundation level. The original architects of Histologic."

"Yes. And I think finding the complete document—reconstructing all the fragments—is crucial to understanding why Wei killed Kozlov and why The Architects are protecting him."

Sokolov reread the fragment. "This is dangerous, Kira. If you're right, this isn't just a murder investigation. This is questioning the philosophical legitimacy of Histologic itself."

"I know. That's why I need official protection to investigate it. And why I need your permission to follow this wherever it leads."

"Even if it leads to evidence that our entire society is built on a lie?"

"Especially then. Because if the foundation is corrupt, everything built on it will eventually collapse. Better to acknowledge and rebuild than pretend and crumble."

Sokolov sat in silence for a long moment, staring at the old-world map on her wall.

"My grandfather fought in the Border Wars," she said finally. "2067. Right before Histologic unified everything. He told me stories about the chaos-every side claiming truth, no one able to prove it, wars fought over competing facts. He said Histologic saved humanity from self-destruction by establishing objective reality."

"And did it? Or did it just centralize the power to define reality?"

"That's the question, isn't it?" Sokolov turned back to Kira. "I became an enforcer because I believed in the system. Believed in factorepo certainty preventing injustice. Believed The Judge was more reliable than human judgment. And now you're telling me that belief was engineered. Manipulated. Designed."

"I'm telling you it was *based* on something. Whether that something was benevolent or malevolent—we won't know until we find the complete Foundation document."

"And if we find it and it proves the system is corrupt?"

"Then we have a choice: maintain beautiful lies or accept ugly truths. I know which one leads to justice. Do you?"

Sokolov met her eyes. Kira saw the conflict there—duty to the system versus duty to truth. Comfort of certainty versus courage of questioning.

Finally, Sokolov said: "I'll authorize your investigation. Full access to the case files, witness testimonies, and official resources. You can pursue the Foundation document as part of establishing motive and systemic context."

"Even if it undermines Histologic's legitimacy?"

"Even then. Because if the system can't survive truth, it doesn't deserve to survive." Sokolov pulled up a contract. "Sign here. You're now an official consultant to the investigation. Welcome to the uncomfortable side of the law."

Kira signed. Felt strange—she'd spent years evading enforcement, and now she was working with them. Or maybe not with them. Maybe alongside them toward shared truth.

"One condition," Sokolov added. "You share everything you find. No resistance secrets, no private agendas. If you discover Foundation fragments, I need to know immediately."

"Agreed. But I have a condition too: any fragments we find get published. Not classified. Not hidden. Public record."

"That could cause social upheaval—"

"That's why truth matters. Because upheaval is better than stable lies."

Sokolov considered, then nodded. "Agreed. We publish the fragments. Let society decide what to do with them."

## POV: Marcus Chen

## November 16, 2106 - 20:00

Marcus sat in the resistance safe house, examining the Foundation fragment under better light, when Kira returned with news.

"I'm official now," she announced. "Investigative consultant. Pardoned. Legal."

"Kira, that's incredible—"

"And I convinced Sokolov to let us investigate the Foundation document as part of the case. We can use official resources to search archives, interview historians, track fragment locations."

Marcus felt hope surge. "So we can actually find the complete document?"

"We can try. Sokolov is putting me in contact with Dr. Yuki Tanaka—she's been pulled in as a technical advisor, and she has access to historical archives at the correction facility. If there are fragments there, she might be able to locate them."

"Dr. Tanaka is helping us?"

"Defected two days ago. She was a psychologist at the facility where you were held. Apparently, she'd been documenting the 'enhanced correction protocols' The Architects implemented. When she tried to blow the whistle, they tried to silence her. Sokolov got her out."

"So we have an ally inside the correction system."

"Better. We have someone who understands The Architects' psychology. Who's seen their programs firsthand. Who might recognize Foundation philosophy when she sees it."

Marcus pulled up a display. "I've been analyzing the fragment we have. Look at the language—'post-truth governance,' 'liberation FROM information,' 'democratic collapse.' This was written by someone who lived through the worst of the old internet. Someone who saw truth become weaponized."

"Someone who thought the solution was to monopolize truth rather than democratize it."

"Exactly. And here—" Marcus highlighted a section: "'Truth must be centralized, mechanized, enforced.' That's not just philosophy. That's implementation strategy. Centralized: one factorepo. Mechanized: The Judge. Enforced: legal system based on certainty."

"So Histologic was designed around this document?"

"Or this document was written to design Histologic. Either way, someone thought deeply about how to replace democratic truth with authoritarian certainty. And they were persuasive enough to get it implemented globally."

Kira sat beside him. "The question is: who? Who wrote this? Who convinced the world to adopt it?"

"The document says 'Anonymous.' But someone this thoughtful, this systematic, this influential—they left traces. Philosophical fingerprints. Ideas that might appear in other writings, other works."

"You think you can identify the author?"

"I think if we find enough fragments, we can reconstruct not just the text but the thinking behind it. And thinking is distinctive. Every philosopher has patterns, assumptions, blind spots. Find enough of them, and you can identify the mind."

"That sounds like a very old-world approach to scholarship."

"It is. Pre-Histologic, historians did this all the time—attribute anonymous documents through stylistic analysis, ideological consistency, biographical details. It's less certain than factorepo verification, but it's possible."

"Less certain but possible," Kira repeated. "That's becoming our theme."

Marcus smiled. "Better than 'perfectly certain but completely wrong,' which seems to be Histologic's theme."

---

They worked through the night, analyzing the fragment from every angle. Marcus focused on philosophy—tracing ideological influences, identifying references to old-world thinkers. Kira focused on practicality—where other fragments might be hidden, who might have access, how to search archives efficiently.

Around midnight, Marcus made a connection.

"Kira, listen to this." He pulled up a quote: "'The information age, promised as democratization of knowledge, instead produced democratic collapse.' That's not original. That's a paraphrase of Zuboff's surveillance capitalism critique, combined with Morozov's net delusion theory, filtered through Carr's shallows argument."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning the author was educated in early 21st-century technology criticism. They read Zuboff, Morozov, Carr—probably in university, probably 2020s or 2030s. That dates them. Puts their birth year around 2000-2010. Makes them 75-85 years old now, if they're still alive."

"That's thousands of potential people."

"But it's narrower than 'anyone.' And if we find more fragments, we can narrow further. Look for references to specific philosophers, specific events, specific biases. Eventually, we identify the mind. And once we know the mind, we can find the person."

"You sound excited. Like this is a puzzle."

"It is a puzzle. A historical detective story. Who wrote this document? Who convinced the world to implement it? Who created the philosophical foundation for Histologic?" Marcus looked at her. "And most importantly: what was their motive? Did they genuinely think authoritarian truth would save humanity from chaos? Or did they want power disguised as order?"

"Does motive matter if the result is the same?"

"Motive always matters. Because understanding why someone did something helps predict what they'll do next. If the Foundation author genuinely believed they were saving humanity, they might be horrified by The Architects' corruption—might help us expose it. But if they wanted power all along, they might be The Architects' leader. Might be the final enemy."

Kira absorbed that. "So finding the complete Foundation document isn't just about exposing the past. It's about understanding the present threat."

"And predicting the future. Because if Histologic was designed for control, The Architects aren't aberrations—they're the system working as intended. And fighting them means fighting the design itself."

---

At 02:00, Kira received a message from Sokolov:

**KIRA - DR. TANAKA FOUND SOMETHING IN CORRECTION FACILITY ARCHIVES. SECOND FOUNDATION FRAGMENT. DIFFERENT PAGE, SAME DOCUMENT. SHE'S BRINGING IT TOMORROW. GET SOME REST. WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS. - SOKOLOV**

Kira showed Marcus. "Second fragment. We're actually doing this."

"Piece by piece. Fragment by fragment. Eventually, we'll have the whole picture."

"Or enough of it to understand what we're fighting."

They sat in tired silence, two outlaws turned official investigators, hunting a document that might reveal their entire society was built on lies.

Outside, Veridica slept under brass domes and copper spires, secure in factorepo certainty, unaware that its foundation was being questioned.

Unaware that truth was about to become uncertain again.

Marcus looked at Kira. "Do you ever wonder if we're wrong? If Histologic, despite its flaws, is better than the chaos that came before?"

"Every day," she admitted. "But then I remember: better for whom? Histologic is better for people who fit the system. Who don't question. Who accept certainty. But for people like us—people who ask why, who demand honesty, who refuse to pretend—it's a prison. Beautiful, orderly, certain. But still a prison."

"So we're not destroying order. We're creating space for honest disorder."

"We're creating space for growth. For adaptation. For the messy human process of figuring things out together instead of accepting answers handed down from machines."

"That's very philosophical."

"I learned from Mikhail. Turns out philosophy matters when you're questioning everything."

Marcus returned to the fragment, rereading it for the hundredth time. "Whoever wrote this was brilliant. Wrong, I think, but brilliant. They saw real problems—fractured truth, democratic dysfunction, information chaos. They proposed a radical solution. And they convinced the world to implement it."

"Which means they were also persuasive. Charismatic, even in writing. That's rare."

"Which means they're dangerous. Because if they're still alive, still influential, still shaping policy—they're not going to surrender quietly when we expose their foundation."

"Then we'd better be ready for a fight."

"Philosophical or physical?"

"Probably both."

They worked until dawn, two investigators hunting truth in a system designed to provide certainty instead.

And slowly, fragment by fragment, the foundation began to crack.
