# Chapter 14: The Witness

## POV: Dmitri Volkov

## November 16, 2106 - 16:00

Dmitri sat across from Captain Sokolov in the interrogation room, feeling the old enforcer training kick in. He'd been on the other side of this table dozens of times—asking the questions, judging the answers, determining guilt or innocence.

Now he was the witness. The one who had to convince rather than convict.

"Tell me about November 15, between 14:00 and 15:00," Sokolov said. "Everything you saw, heard, experienced."

Dmitri took a breath. "I was providing security for Alexei's extraction operation. We were pulling two resistance members from deep cover—Marina Petrov and Jakob Chen. The operation was planned for 14:25 to 14:55, inside Elena's chaos window."

"Why that specific window?"

"Because Elena had coordinated multiple operations to occur simultaneously. Border crossings. Defections. Evidence uploads. The idea was to overwhelm Veridica's security apparatus—too many incidents happening at once for effective response."

"A coordinated resistance operation."

"Yes. But we didn't know someone else was planning to use the same window for murder."

Sokolov made notes. "Walk me through your timeline. Minute by minute if you can."

Dmitri had been trained to observe, to remember details, to reconstruct events accurately. The irony wasn't lost on him—he was using enforcer skills to help prove an outlaw's innocence.

"14:25: Alexei and I arrived at the extraction point. Secure apartment in the government quarter, three blocks from the Executive Building. Marina and Jakob were waiting."

"How far from the Executive Building? Exact distance?"

"Three blocks east. Approximately 300 meters." Dmitri pulled up a mental map. "Line of sight to the main entrance. We could see people coming and going."

"Continue."

"14:27: Identity verification. We confirmed Marina and Jakob were who they claimed to be. Resistance protocols—code phrases, physical recognition signs, behavioral tells. Both checked out."

"14:30: We began moving them to extraction vehicles. Two blocks to the safe house where transport was waiting. We took a route that avoided major surveillance points."

"How did you know which points to avoid?"

"I used to work enforcement. I know where the cameras are, where the sensor grids overlap, where the blind spots exist." Dmitri felt a pang of guilt. "I used my old knowledge to undermine the system I once protected."

"You feel conflicted about that."

"I feel..." Dmitri searched for words. "I feel like I was trained to serve justice, and for years I believed the system was just. Then I learned it wasn't. Learned that enforcement was being used to suppress truth rather than protect it. So yes, I'm conflicted. I'm using skills I learned in service of a corrupt system to fight that same corruption."

Sokolov's expression softened. "That's called growth, Dmitri. Recognizing when you were wrong and choosing to do right. Continue with your timeline."

"14:32: We were moving through the plaza when I saw someone entering the Executive Building. East entrance. They moved with purpose—not casual, not panicked. Controlled. Professional."

"Describe them."

"Height approximately 175 to 177 centimeters. Medium build. Dark jacket with brass buttons—standard government issue. Face partially obscured by collar, but I noted the gait."

"The gait?"

"Everyone moves differently. Enforcers are trained to recognize people by movement patterns. This person moved like someone with technical training, not combat training. Precise but not aggressive. Efficient but not tactical."

"Could you identify them?"

"Not definitively. But I can tell you who it wasn't."

"Marcus Chen?"

"Marcus is 178 centimeters, moves more hesitantly, like someone who thinks before acting. This person moved with certainty. Also, Marcus was supposed to be uploading evidence during that window. He had no reason to be at the Executive Building."

"What happened next?"

"14:35: We heard something that might have been a gunshot. Muffled, distant. Could have been many things—a door slamming, a vehicle backfiring, construction noise. But my training said gunshot."

"Did you investigate?"

"No. My priority was the extraction. Two lives depending on me. I couldn't abandon them to investigate a sound." Dmitri's jaw tightened. "Maybe if I had..."

"You'd have died too, or been framed for murder," Sokolov said firmly. "You made the right tactical choice."

"The enforcer choice. Protect the mission. But maybe not the right moral choice."

"Dmitri, you can't save everyone. You can only do what's possible in the moment you're in."

They sat in silence for a moment.

Finally, Dmitri continued: "14:43: Extraction complete. Marina and Jakob safely in transport vehicles. Alexei and I separated—he went with the transports, I stayed to ensure no pursuit. By 14:50, I confirmed we were clean. No one followed. No alerts raised."

"15:00: The hour ended. I left the area. Didn't know about the murder until the next day."

Sokolov reviewed her notes. "You witnessed someone entering the Executive Building at 14:32. Heard what you believe was a gunshot at 14:35. Time of death is estimated between 14:20 and 14:30, most likely 14:23 based on other evidence. Your gunshot might have been something else."

"Or the estimate is wrong," Dmitri said. "Medical examiners aren't perfect without factorepo environmental data. The shot could have been at 14:35."

"Possible. Or you heard an echo, a delayed sound, something unrelated." Sokolov pulled up an image. "This is Thomas Wei. Senior Systems Architect. Does this match the person you saw?"

Dmitri studied the photo. "Height matches. Build matches. I can't confirm the face—I didn't see it clearly. But the movement pattern... yes. That fits someone with technical training rather than combat training."

"Wei is 176 centimeters. Owns a dark jacket with brass buttons identical to what you described. Has access codes to the Executive Building. And his badge log shows he entered at 14:23—nine minutes before you saw someone enter."

"Two different people? Or the badge log is wrong?"

"Or Wei entered at 14:23 through a secure entrance that didn't require visible access, killed Kozlov, and exited at 14:32 through the east entrance where you saw him."

Dmitri felt the pieces click together. "That would explain the timeline. Entry at 14:23. Murder within minutes. Exit at 14:32. The gunshot I heard at 14:35 was something else—or I misremembered the time in the chaos."

"Your testimony places someone matching Wei's description at the scene during the critical window. Combined with the badge logs, the deletion code, the other evidence—it builds a strong case."

"But not definitive."

"No. Not without factorepo certainty. But strong enough that a jury of humans could reasonably conclude guilt."

Dmitri leaned back. "I've spent my life relying on factorepo certainty. Convictions based on perfect evidence. And now you're telling me we're going to convict someone on reasonable conclusion?"

"On the preponderance of human evidence. Multiple witnesses, physical proof, logical reconstruction. The way justice worked before Histologic."

"The way I was taught was inferior. Unreliable. Subject to human error."

"It is subject to human error," Sokolov agreed. "But it's also resilient to human manipulation. Wei could erase factorepo data, but he couldn't erase your memory. Couldn't erase the badge logs. Couldn't erase all the witnesses. The old system had flaws, but it also had strengths we forgot when we centralized everything into machines."

Later, Dmitri found Mikhail in the building's small garden, playing his guitar softly.

"Captain Sokolov says you're testifying tomorrow," Dmitri said, sitting on a brass bench.

"I am. About memory. About how we preserved truth before machines." Mikhail finished a chord progression. "You did the same today. Preserved truth through testimony."

"It feels uncertain. Like I'm not sure enough to condemn someone."

"And yet you were sure enough when you relied on factorepo data?"

"That was different. Facts are certain."

"Are they?" Mikhail played a melancholy melody. "Facts are just data points. Interpretation still requires judgment. The factorepo told you your brother Alexei was a criminal. Was that fact certain?"

Dmitri felt the old wound. "The factorepo was correct about his actions. He did help people escape. He did resist enforcement."

"But was he a criminal? Or was he a freedom fighter? The facts were the same, but the truth—the deeper truth about whether his actions were right or wrong—that required judgment. Human judgment."

"So you're saying facts aren't enough?"

"I'm saying facts are necessary but not sufficient. They tell us what happened. They don't tell us what it means." Mikhail set down his guitar. "Before Histologic, we understood this. We knew that truth required both evidence and wisdom. But we got seduced by the promise of certainty. Convinced ourselves that if we just had enough facts, we wouldn't need judgment."

"But that was a lie."

"That was an oversimplification. Facts help. Evidence matters. But humans still have to decide what to do with them. And when we gave that decision-making to machines, we lost something important."

Dmitri thought about his years as an enforcer. How many people had he arrested based on factorepo data alone? How many had he convicted without considering context, motivation, deeper truth?

"I hunted my own brother," he said quietly. "Because the facts said he was criminal."

"And now?"

"Now I know the facts were incomplete. They showed what he did, but not why. Not that he was saving people from persecution. Not that the system itself was corrupt."

"So what changed? Did the facts change?"

"No. My judgment changed. I saw the larger truth beyond the facts."

"Exactly." Mikhail picked up his guitar again. "That's what we lost when we let machines do our thinking. We stopped asking why. Stopped questioning context. Stopped using wisdom alongside evidence."

He began to play and sing, a song Dmitri hadn't heard before:

*"The facts will tell you what, but never why*  
*The data shows you how, but not what for*  
*A machine can record a thousand truths and lies*  
*But wisdom asks what meaning we're living for*

*Before the judges were machines*  
*Before the truth was data streams*  
*We had to think and we had to feel*  
*And sometimes truth was more than real*

*The facts said he was guilty, the judgment was clear*  
*But facts don't know that justice needs more*  
*Than perfect evidence and certain fear*  
*Truth requires the wisdom that machines ignore"*

The song faded. Dmitri sat in silence, feeling something shift in his understanding.

"You're saying the old way was better?" he asked finally.

"I'm saying both ways have value. Facts without wisdom become tyranny. Wisdom without facts becomes chaos. We need both." Mikhail looked at the brass structures surrounding them. "Histologic promised to eliminate uncertainty. But uncertainty isn't a bug—it's a feature. It's what makes us think, question, grow. When we tried to eliminate it, we eliminated growth."

"So how do we fix it?"

"By remembering what we forgot. That machines should assist human judgment, not replace it. That facts should inform wisdom, not substitute for it. That certainty is less important than freedom to question."

"Will Wei's trial prove that?"

"Perhaps. It will be the first time Veridica convicts someone using human testimony instead of factorepo certainty. If it works—if justice can be served without perfect evidence—it proves the system can evolve. Can acknowledge its limitations. Can become something better than it was."

"And if it doesn't work?"

"Then we learn what doesn't work and try something else. That's how humans progress—through trial and error, through learning from mistakes, through adapting. Machines don't do that. They just follow their programming until someone changes it. Humans can change themselves."

Dmitri stood to leave, then paused. "Mikhail, when you testify tomorrow—what will you say?"

"I'll tell the truth. That we remembered before machines. That memory matters. That human witnesses can establish facts through collective corroboration. That the lost hour lives in us, not in databases." Mikhail smiled. "And I'll sing. Because songs carry truths that can't be factchecked. Love. Hope. Justice. The things that make us human."

"The court might not accept that."

"Then the court needs to expand its definition of evidence. Because if justice can't accommodate humanity, it's not really justice."

---

That night, Dmitri couldn't sleep. He kept thinking about Mikhail's words. About facts and wisdom. About certainty and growth. About the system he'd served and the brother he'd hunted.

He pulled out his comm device and composed a message to Alexei:

**BROTHER - I TESTIFIED TODAY. ABOUT THE LOST HOUR. ABOUT SEEING WEI AT THE EXECUTIVE BUILDING. ABOUT US EXTRACTING MARINA AND JAKOB. I USED MY ENFORCER TRAINING TO HELP PROVE AN OUTLAW'S INNOCENCE. THE IRONY ISN'T LOST ON ME. - D**

The reply came quickly:

**THE BEST IRONY. YOU WERE TRAINED TO SERVE JUSTICE. NOW YOU ACTUALLY ARE. PROUD OF YOU, BROTHER. - A**

Another message appeared, from Nikolai:

**DMITRI - YOUR TESTIMONY WAS CRUCIAL. WEI CAN'T EXPLAIN AWAY BEING AT THE SCENE. CAN'T DISMISS A WITNESS TRAINED TO OBSERVE. YOU DID GOOD. - N**

Dmitri stared at the messages. His brothers—one he'd hunted, one he'd doubted—both expressing pride. Both acknowledging that his old skills could serve new purposes.

Maybe that was the lesson. Maybe systems and people weren't purely good or evil. Maybe everything was context. Maybe the same skills that had made him an effective enforcer could make him an effective witness. Maybe the same system that had oppressed could be reformed to liberate.

Maybe certainty wasn't the goal. Maybe growth was.

He sent a final message to both brothers:

**TOMORROW MIKHAIL TESTIFIES. SAYS HE'LL SING ABOUT MEMORY AND TRUTH. SAYS HUMANS CAN DO WHAT MACHINES CAN'T—GROW AND CHANGE. I THINK HE'S RIGHT. I THINK WE'RE ALL PROOF OF THAT. - D**

Alexei responded:

**MIKHAIL IS ALWAYS RIGHT. IT'S ANNOYING BUT TRUE. SEE YOU AT THE TRIAL. - A**

Nikolai added:

**BRINGING POPCORN. WANT TO SEE COURT'S REACTION TO PHILOSOPHICAL SONGS. THIS WILL BE INTERESTING. - N**

Despite the gravity of the situation, Dmitri smiled. His brothers. Different paths, same destination. Different methods, same goal.

Tomorrow, Mikhail would testify. Would explain how humans established truth before machines. Would sing about memory and wisdom and growth.

And maybe—just maybe—the court would listen.

Maybe justice could evolve.

Maybe they all could.
