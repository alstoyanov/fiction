# Chapter 5: The Accusation

## POV: Marcus Chen

## November 15, 2106 - 16:00

The enforcers came at 16:00, exactly one hour after the lost hour ended.

Marcus and Kira were in their safe house, monitoring news feeds about the factorepo failure, when the door exploded inward in a shower of splintered wood and brass fittings.

"HANDS VISIBLE! NOW!"

Six enforcers in full tactical gear poured through the opening, weapons drawn, moving with military precision. Marcus raised his hands immediately—he'd seen what happened to people who resisted arrest.

"Marcus Chen, you're under arrest for the murder of Minister Viktor Kozlov. You have the right to—"

"What?" Marcus's mind reeled. "Kozlov is dead?"

"Don't play stupid. Down on the ground. NOW."

Marcus complied, face pressed against the copper-inlaid floor, hands being zip-tied behind his back. Around him, enforcers were searching the room, collecting equipment, photographing everything.

"Kira Osman?" The lead enforcer turned toward Kira, who stood frozen by her workstation.

She ran.

In any other situation, it would have been futile—six armed enforcers against one unarmed woman. But Kira had planned for this. She'd known eventually they'd be raided.

She slammed a button on her workstation and the room filled with smoke—not tear gas, just dense, harmless smoke that obscured vision and triggered the building's fire alarms. In the chaos, she disappeared through a hidden exit panel Marcus hadn't even known existed.

"AFTER HER!"

Three enforcers followed her through the smoke. Three remained with Marcus.

"Smart girlfriend," one enforcer commented. "Shame she won't get far."

Marcus said nothing. If Kira had escaped, she'd find help. She'd figure out what was happening. She'd prove his innocence.

If she escaped.

The enforcer hauled Marcus to his feet. "Marcus Chen, you stand accused of murdering Minister Viktor Kozlov at approximately 14:30 today. Under normal circumstances, The Judge would review the factorepo evidence and determine guilt. But since the hour in question has been erased—conveniently erased, one might say—we have to rely on other evidence."

"I didn't kill anyone."

"Of course you didn't. And I'm sure you have an alibi for 14:30. Care to share it?"

Marcus hesitated. His alibi was being in this safe house, uploading corruption evidence. Admitting that would confirm he'd acted during the lost hour, even if the action was legal. It would make him suspicious.

But lying would be worse.

"I was here. Uploading documents to a secure archive."

"What kind of documents?"

"Evidence of government corruption."

The enforcer laughed. "So you admit you were conducting illegal operations during the lost hour?"

"It's not illegal to upload documents."

"It is when you're a convicted outlaw operating without authorization. And it's especially interesting that you were uploading 'evidence of corruption' during the exact hour that someone murdered a Minister who was about to expose corruption." The enforcer leaned close. "That's what we call means, motive, and opportunity."

"I wasn't at the Executive Building. I was here."

"Can you prove that?"

"The upload logs—"

"Show that someone uploaded files from an anonymized proxy network. They don't show where the uploader physically was. For all we know, you uploaded the files, then went to Kozlov's office and killed him."

"That's not what happened."

"Then what did happen?"

Marcus met the enforcer's eyes. "I was here from 14:00 to 15:00. Kira was with me. We uploaded three months of evidence documenting systematic corruption in Veridica's Histologic implementation. We never left this room."

"And your evidence of this?"

"The upload timestamp. The proxy routing. Kira's testimony."

"The fugitive's testimony. Very convincing." The enforcer pulled Marcus toward the door. "Let's go. You can explain all this to Captain Sokolov."

They took him to Central Enforcement Headquarters in an armored transport. Marcus sat in the back, hands still bound, trying to piece together what had happened.

Kozlov was dead. Murdered around 14:30—exactly when Marcus was supposed to meet him. And someone had erased the hour from the factorepo, making it impossible to verify anyone's location during that time.

Which meant someone had framed him. Someone had known about the meeting, killed Kozlov during it, and erased the evidence that would prove Marcus wasn't there.

Someone sophisticated. Someone with deep technical access and planning capability.

Someone like Wei, the name Maya had mentioned in her message.

The transport stopped. They hauled Marcus out into an underground garage—all brass and copper, the aesthetic of Histologic efficiency applied to detention. They processed him through intake: photographed, fingerprinted, property catalogued.

Then they put him in an interrogation room.

It was smaller than he expected. Brass table. Two chairs. Copper-mesh walls that probably blocked comm signals. A single brass lamp casting harsh light.

Marcus sat alone for thirty minutes before Captain Sokolov entered.

She was shorter than he expected, with the bearing of someone who'd earned her authority through competence rather than politics. She carried a brass tablet and sat across from him without preamble.

"Marcus Chen. Age 29. Former factorepo analyst. Convicted of ideological contamination three months ago. Escaped correction facility in August. Currently wanted for—" She consulted her tablet. "Seventeen charges of unlawful resistance, three charges of data theft, and now one charge of murder."

"I didn't kill Minister Kozlov."

"Everyone says that. Usually they're lying." Sokolov set down the tablet. "But in your case, I'm inclined to believe you."

Marcus blinked. "You are?"

"The murder was professional. Single shot, precise placement, no struggle. You're an analyst, not an assassin. Your record shows no violent tendencies. And frankly, if you wanted Kozlov dead, you'd have done it months ago when you were still free and unmonitored."

"Then why arrest me?"

"Because you're the obvious suspect. You had a scheduled meeting with Kozlov at 14:30. You had motive—he was supposed to provide testimony supporting your cause. You were operating during the lost hour. And you can't prove you weren't at his office because the hour was erased." Sokolov leaned forward. "You're the perfect patsy."

"Someone framed me."

"Obviously. The question is who."

Marcus studied her. "Why are you telling me this? Why not just charge me and let The Judge decide?"

"Because The Judge can't decide. Not without factorepo data. This is the first murder in Veridica's history that we have to investigate without perfect records. We have to rely on physical evidence, witness testimony, and deductive reasoning. Old methods. Uncertain methods."

"And you think I'm innocent."

"I think you're not stupid enough to commit murder during an hour you knew would be erased, then immediately admit you were operating during that hour. If you'd killed Kozlov, you'd have a better alibi."

Marcus almost laughed. "My innocence is proven by my incompetent alibi?"

"In a way, yes." Sokolov pulled up files on her tablet. "Tell me about the upload. What exactly were you and Kira doing between 14:00 and 15:00?"

Marcus made a decision. If Sokolov believed him, if she was investigating honestly, he needed to trust her.

"We uploaded three months of evidence to secure archive servers. Documentation of corruption in Veridica's factorepo system. Proof that officials have been manipulating facts for political purposes. Evidence that The Judge has been compromised."

"And this evidence exists where?"

"The upload completed at 14:54:27. It's timestamped in the secure archives. It should have survived the erasure because it was logged before the corruption reached it."

Sokolov made notes. "Can you access it?"

"Not from detention. But Kira can, if she escaped. Or Maya Reeves—she's a factorepo technician who could retrieve it."

"Maya. Yes. She's helping with the investigation." Sokolov looked up. "Did you know Minister Kozlov was going to be killed?"

"No. But I suspected something might happen. Elena warned us that multiple operations were happening during that hour. She had a bad feeling."

"Elena Volkov. Resistance leader."

"Yes. She coordinated the timing. My upload, her extractions, Isaiah's border crossing, Dr. Tanaka's defector assistance. All during the same hour to create chaos and confusion."

"Chaos that someone else used to commit murder."

"Exactly." Marcus leaned forward despite his bound hands. "Captain, someone with deep technical access erased that hour. Someone who knew about all our operations and used them as cover. Someone who could kill a Minister and make it look like I did it."

"You're describing someone like Thomas Wei."

"Who?"

"Senior Systems Architect. He's leading the investigation into the factorepo failure. And according to Maya Reeves, his coding signature matches the deletion script."

"Then he's your killer."

"Possibly. But I can't arrest him on suspicion. I need evidence. And thanks to him erasing the hour, evidence is exactly what I don't have."

They sat in silence for a moment.

Finally, Sokolov said, "Here's what's going to happen. Officially, you're being held for questioning regarding Kozlov's murder. Unofficially, I believe you're innocent but I need you somewhere safe while I investigate Wei. If I release you, Wei might target you to tie up loose ends. If you're in detention, he can't reach you."

"You're protecting me by arresting me."

"Exactly. Consider it protective custody."

"And Kira?"

"If she's smart—and I suspect she is—she'll go underground and gather evidence from outside. Between her investigation, Maya's technical analysis, and my official inquiry, we might be able to prove Wei is the killer."

"How long do I stay here?"

"Until I have enough evidence to arrest Wei. Or until he makes a mistake." Sokolov stood. "One more question: the evidence you uploaded. If I could access it, would it prove Veridica's corruption?"

"Yes. Definitively."

"Then it's crucial we retrieve it. Because if Kozlov died to prevent that evidence from being exposed, the best way to honor his sacrifice is to make sure it sees daylight."

Marcus nodded. "Captain, there's something else you should know. Dmitri Volkov—one of the Volkov brothers—sent me a message during the lost hour. He witnessed someone entering the Executive Building at 14:23. Wrong height for me, wrong movement pattern. He thinks it might have been the killer."

Sokolov made a note. "Where is Dmitri now?"

"With the resistance. But he might testify if it means catching Kozlov's killer."

"I'll contact him." Sokolov walked to the door, then paused. "Marcus, I'm trusting you not to escape. This facility is secure, but I suspect a man who broke out of a correction facility could manage if motivated. Don't. Stay here. Stay safe. Let me investigate."

"I will. But Captain—find Kira. Make sure Wei doesn't target her."

"Already on it. She escaped the raid and disappeared into the underground. My team is monitoring for her, but gently. We'll bring her in for protection when we locate her."

After Sokolov left, Marcus sat alone in the interrogation room, processing everything.

Kozlov was dead. The hour was erased. Marcus was framed. Wei was the likely killer. And somewhere out there, Kira was gathering evidence to prove it.

All he could do was wait. And trust that the people fighting for truth would find it, even when that truth existed in an hour that had been lost.
