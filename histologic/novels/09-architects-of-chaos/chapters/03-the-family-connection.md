# Chapter 3: The Family Connection

**Date**: January 25, 2115  
**Location**: Dmitri Volkov's Home

---

Marcus arrived at Dmitri Volkov's home after dark, using back streets and avoiding surveillance cameras. If the architects were watching—and Marcus had to assume they were—he couldn't be seen meeting with key allies. Not yet. Not until they were ready.

Dmitri opened the door before Marcus could knock. The former soldier's instincts were still sharp. He ushered Marcus inside quickly, checked the street, then closed and locked the door.

"You're being careful," Dmitri observed. "That means trouble."

"The worst kind," Marcus said.

They moved to Dmitri's study—a room he'd swept for surveillance devices that morning. Old habits from his military days. Dmitri poured two glasses of whiskey, handed one to Marcus, then sat down.

"Show me."

Marcus activated a portable holographic projector. Data filled the space between them. Signatures. Patterns. Evidence. And then, the name that would change everything for Dmitri:

**AV-05: Adrian Volkov**

Dmitri stared at the signature. "That's... that's my uncle. My father's brother."

"Yes."

"He was a historian. A professor. He died ten years ago."

"He was also one of the twelve architects who built and controlled the Histologic system."

---

Marcus pulled up more evidence. Adrian Volkov's academic career. His consulting work for governments. His influence on The Judge's historical verification protocols. His signature in the code that determined what counted as "fact" and what didn't.

"He controlled the past, Dmitri. And whoever controls the past controls the future. That's what Orwell wrote in '1984.' Your uncle lived it."

Dmitri took a long drink of whiskey. He remembered Uncle Adrian. Quiet. Thoughtful. Always reading. Always writing. He'd visit the family once or twice a year, bringing books for the children, telling stories about history. Dmitri had admired him. Wanted to be like him.

"You're saying my uncle was part of a conspiracy to enslave humanity?"

"I'm saying he was part of a group that believed humanity needed to be controlled. For its own good. To prevent another Fracture. Another World War. They genuinely thought they were saving people."

"By taking away their freedom."

"By giving them certainty. Structure. Peace. They saw it as a trade. Freedom for safety. Chaos for order. They thought it was worth it."

---

Dmitri thought about his family. His parents—both dead now, killed in a resistance operation during the Battle of Blood. His brother Alexei—dead too, sacrificed destroying SFW artillery. His siblings Nikolai and Elena—still alive, still fighting.

Were they targeted? Was their family chosen deliberately?

Marcus showed him more evidence. The Volkov family's involvement in every major crisis:

**Dmitri's military career**: He'd been at every critical battle. Iron Ridge. The siege of the capital. The final defense. Always in the right place at the right time. Or the wrong place, depending on perspective. His promotions had been rapid. His assignments strategic. His influence growing.

**Elena's resistance work**: She'd been in every occupied territory. Leading cells. Coordinating operations. Her network was vast, well-organized, impossibly effective. How had a civilian built such a network? Unless someone had helped her. Guided her. Positioned her.

**Nikolai's technical expertise**: He'd helped build The Counselor. The replacement for The Judge. The next phase of control. Had he been chosen for that role? Guided toward it?

**Alexei's sacrifice**: He'd died destroying SFW artillery at the exact moment when his death would inspire maximum resistance. His sacrifice had turned the tide of the battle. Had that moment been designed? Had his death been calculated?

---

"We weren't just participants," Marcus said. "We were instruments. The architects positioned your family to play specific roles in their grand design."

Dmitri felt rage building. His brother had died in a war that might have been designed. He'd spent five years honoring that sacrifice. Believing it mattered. Believing Alexei chose to die for something real.

But what if it was all manipulation? What if Alexei's heroism was just another designed outcome? What if his death was just another data point in the architects' plan?

"No," Dmitri said. "Alexei chose. He made that decision. No one forced him to stay at that artillery position. No one forced him to hold the line while others escaped. That was his choice."

"I'm not saying they forced him. I'm saying they created the context where that choice seemed necessary. They designed the war. They designed the artillery position. They designed the moment when someone had to sacrifice themselves. And your family—because of your uncle—was positioned to provide that someone."

---

Dmitri wanted to reject it. Wanted to believe his brother's death meant something pure. Something untainted by conspiracy. Something real.

But he'd been a soldier too long. He knew how wars were fought. How battles were planned. How sacrifices were calculated. And if the architects had controlled everything, they'd controlled the war. Which meant they'd controlled Alexei's death.

He stood, walked to the window, looked out at the night. His hands were shaking. Not from fear. From rage.

"I'm in," he said. "Whatever you need. We find these architects. We expose them. We end this."

Marcus nodded. "I need you to investigate the military connections. If the architects controlled everything, they controlled the wars. Find out how. Find the patterns. Trace the manipulation."

"I'll use my position as Defense Minister. Access classified records. Military communications. Battle plans. I'll find the evidence."

"Be careful. If they're watching—"

"Let them watch. I'm done being careful. I'm done being their instrument."

---

Dmitri thought about Alexei. About his quiet competence. His willingness to sacrifice. His belief that his death would matter. His final words over the radio: "Tell them it was worth it. Tell them we won."

Had it been worth it? Had they won? Or had they just moved from one cage to another?

Dmitri made a vow: "Alexei, if your death was designed, I'll make it mean something real. I'll expose the bastards who used you. I'll free humanity from their control. I promise."

It was a promise to a dead brother. But it was also a promise to himself. To his surviving siblings. To his parents' memory. To everyone who'd died thinking they were fighting for freedom.

If the architects existed, if they'd really controlled everything, then all those deaths needed to mean something. Needed to lead to real freedom. Not designed freedom. Not controlled freedom. Real freedom.

Even if real freedom was terrifying. Even if real freedom was chaotic. Even if real freedom led to another Fracture.

Better to die free than live enslaved.

That's what Alexei believed. That's what he died for. And Dmitri would honor that belief.

---

Marcus prepared to leave. "We're meeting again in a week. I'll have more evidence by then. You work on the military angle. Kira's handling technical. Isaiah's investigating international connections. We're building the case."

"And when we have enough evidence?"

"We expose them. All at once. Everywhere. Make it impossible to suppress."

"They'll fight back."

"I know. But we've fought before. And we've won before. We'll win again."

Dmitri walked Marcus to the door. Before opening it, he said: "Marcus, thank you. For trusting me with this. For including me. For... for helping me understand what really happened to Alexei."

"We don't know for sure yet. This is still theory. Still hypothesis."

"But it fits. It explains too much. And my gut says it's true. Soldier's instinct."

"Then trust your instinct. And help me prove it."

They shook hands. Brothers in arms. Not by blood, but by choice. By shared purpose. By determination to free humanity from hidden control.

Marcus slipped out into the night. Dmitri watched him go, then closed the door.

He returned to his study. Looked at the holographic data still floating in the air. His uncle's signature. His family's manipulation. His brother's designed death.

He thought of an old saying: "The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off."

He was pissed off. Enraged. Determined.

And he would be free. They all would be free.

Or they would die trying.
