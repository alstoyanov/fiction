# Chapter 25: The Architects Flee

**Date**: May 11, 2115  
**Location**: Architects' Emergency Meeting  
**POV**: Dr. Helena Voss (Architect)  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,500 words

## Summary

The architects meet in emergency session. They're exposed. Hunted. Finished.

Voss: "We underestimated them. We thought exposure would cause chaos. It did. But they're handling it. They don't need us."

Some architects captured already. Others in hiding. They need to flee.

Chairman Viktor Kozlov of CNT offers sanctuary: "Come to CNT. We don't use factorepos. You'll be safe here."

Most architects agree to flee. A few refuse.

Dr. Wei Zhang stands: "I won't run. I created the psychology of control. I was wrong. My son Thomas became a monster following my teachings. I won't compound that by fleeing."

He surrenders to authorities. Will testify against the others.

The remaining architects flee to CNT. Voss, Liu Wei, Okonkwo, Tanaka, Kovač, Morrison, Elena Sokolov, Chen Zhao. Eight architects escaping to CNT.

As they flee, Voss records a final message: "We tried to save humanity from itself. We failed. But mark my words: without us, the chaos returns. The Fracture returns. War returns. You'll beg us to come back. Or you'll find new architects. Because humans need control. That's the truth we learned. That's the truth you'll learn."
