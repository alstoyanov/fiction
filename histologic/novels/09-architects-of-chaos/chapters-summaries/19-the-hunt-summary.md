# Chapter 19: The Hunt

**Date**: April 25, 2115  
**Location**: Multiple Locations  
**POV**: Colonel James Morrison (Architect)  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,000 words

## Summary

Colonel Morrison leads the manhunt. He's an architect—the operative. Finding people is his specialty.

He tracks Marcus's team across nations. Gets close several times. But the resistance always helps them escape. It's frustrating. The resistance is more organized than he expected.

He realizes: they're not just hiding. They're preparing. They're still planning something. And it's happening soon.

He reports to Voss: "They're going to strike at our meeting. I'm certain."

"Then we'll be ready," Voss says. "Let them come. Let them try. We'll show the world what happens when you challenge the architects."

Morrison isn't so confident. He's seen Marcus fight before. Seen him win against impossible odds. This might not be as easy as Voss thinks.
