# Chapter 24: The Chaos

**Date**: May 9-10, 2115  
**Location**: Multiple Government Centers  
**POV**: General Sokolov  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,200 words

## Summary

Governments across Histologic nations in crisis. Some leaders were architect puppets. Others were ignorant. All are questioned.

Mass protests. Demands for accountability. Calls for revolution.

But there's also resistance to change. People in their 60s and 70s—those who remember the Fracture Years—are terrified. "You want to go back to chaos?" they shout at protesters. "You want fact wars again? You're too young to remember!"

Generational divide emerges:
- **Older generation** (60s-70s): "The architects saved us. This is ungrateful."
- **Middle generation** (40s-50s): "We were taught to trust them. Now what?"
- **Younger generation** (20s-30s): "We never chose this. We want freedom."

Sokolov coordinates with military forces to maintain order. Not to suppress protests—to protect them. To ensure peaceful transition.

"The architects controlled us," she tells her troops. "But we choose what happens next. Some of you remember the Before Times. Some of you were taught to fear them. Some of you only know Histologic. But we all get to choose now. We choose order. We choose peace. We choose freedom. Even if it's scary. Even if it's uncertain."

It's chaos. But productive chaos. Humanity waking up. Demanding truth. Demanding freedom.

The architects' prediction—that exposure would cause catastrophic collapse—isn't happening. Yes, there's chaos. Yes, some resist change. But humans are handling it. They're not fracturing. They're uniting. Against the architects. Despite their fear. Despite their trauma.
