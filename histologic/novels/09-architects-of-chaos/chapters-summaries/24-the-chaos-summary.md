# Chapter 24: The Chaos

**Date**: May 9-10, 2115  
**Location**: Multiple Government Centers  
**POV**: General Sokolov  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,200 words

## Summary

Governments across Histologic nations in crisis. Some leaders were architect puppets. Others were ignorant. All are questioned.

Mass protests. Demands for accountability. Calls for revolution.

Sokolov coordinates with military forces to maintain order. Not to suppress protests—to protect them. To ensure peaceful transition.

"The architects controlled us," she tells her troops. "But we choose what happens next. We choose order. We choose peace. We choose freedom."

It's chaos. But productive chaos. Humanity waking up. Demanding truth. Demanding freedom.

The architects' prediction—that exposure would cause catastrophic collapse—isn't happening. Yes, there's chaos. But humans are handling it. They're not fracturing. They're uniting. Against the architects.
