# Chapter 26: The Defector

**Date**: May 12, 2115  
**Location**: Detention Center  
**POV**: Dr. Wei Zhang (Architect)  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,500 words

## Summary

Dr. Wei Zhang surrenders. Provides testimony against the other architects.

"I created the psychology of control," he confesses. "I studied how to manipulate masses. How to shape beliefs. How to make people obey without knowing they're obeying."

"My son Thomas learned from me. He became what I taught. He corrupted The Judge. He hurt people. And it was my fault. I gave him the tools. I showed him the methods."

"I can't undo that. But I can help you understand the architects. Help you prevent this from happening again."

He provides complete evidence. Meeting records. Financial transactions. Communication logs. Everything.

Marcus visits him: "Why now? Why surrender?"

"Because I'm 58 years old and I've spent 30 years enslaving humanity. I want to spend whatever time I have left freeing them. It's not redemption. It's just... less guilt."

Wei Zhang's testimony is crucial. He explains the architects' complete system. How they recruited. How they coordinated. How they controlled.

Most importantly, he reveals something shocking: "There were supposed to be thirteen architects. Not twelve. The thirteenth was... different. I don't know who. The signature was always corrupted. But they were the most important. The one who made everything possible."

Marcus: "DV-12. The corrupted signature. Who is it?"

"I don't know. None of us knew. Not even Voss. The thirteenth architect worked through us without us knowing. Guided us. Shaped us. We thought we were in control. But maybe... maybe we were puppets too."

This revelation changes everything. The twelve architects weren't the top. There's a thirteenth. Still hidden. Still active.

**Song Reference**: "Behind Blue Eyes" (The Who) - "No one knows what it's like to be the bad man, to be the sad man, behind blue eyes."
