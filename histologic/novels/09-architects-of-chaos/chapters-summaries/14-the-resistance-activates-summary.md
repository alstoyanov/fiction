## Summary

Elena activates her global resistance network—cells in every Histologic nation, built over decades. They've been preparing for threats. Now they know the real threat: the architects.

She coordinates simultaneous actions for the day of exposure. When the truth hits the factorepos, resistance fighters will protect key infrastructure, prevent architect loyalists from suppressing information, ensure the truth spreads.

"We've been fighting shadows our whole lives," she tells her network. "Now we fight the people who cast those shadows."

The resistance is ready. Thousands of fighters. Waiting for the signal.
