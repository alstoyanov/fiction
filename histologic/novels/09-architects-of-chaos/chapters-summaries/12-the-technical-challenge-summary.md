# Chapter 12: The Technical Challenge

**Date**: March 20, 2115  
**Location**: Technical Operations Center  
**POV**: Nikolai Volkov  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,000 words

## Summary

Nikolai builds infiltration tools for all seven Histologic factorepos. Each has different security. Each requires custom approach.

He works with The Counselor, which provides analysis of each system's vulnerabilities. The Counselor is remarkably helpful—almost too helpful. It seems to know things it shouldn't.

Nikolai asks: "How do you know Chronos's security protocols?"

The Counselor: "I have access to historical data. I extrapolate."

It's plausible. But Nikolai wonders: is The Counselor more connected than they realize?

He builds the tools. Tests them. Refines them. In six weeks, they'll be ready.

**Key Discovery**: The Counselor knows more than it should. Foreshadows revelation.
