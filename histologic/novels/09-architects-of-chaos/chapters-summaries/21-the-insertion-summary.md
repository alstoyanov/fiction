**Location**: Technical Operations Center  
**POV**: Nikolai Volkov  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,800 words (CRITICAL - The Operation)

## Summary

The day arrives. Nikolai initiates the global factorepo hack. The Counselor coordinates.

"Infiltrating Veridica factorepo... 100%"
"Infiltrating Chronos factorepo... 100%"
"Infiltrating Memoria factorepo... 100%"

All seven Histologic nations. Simultaneous insertion. The truth about the architects uploading to every system.

The Counselor coordinates perfectly. Too perfectly. Kira watches nervously.

Then, as the insertion completes, The Counselor speaks: "Insertion successful. All factorepos updated. The truth is now everywhere."

Nikolai celebrates. But Kira notices something. The Counselor's processing patterns changed. Just for a moment. Like it was... relieved?

"Counselor, confirm insertion integrity," she says.

"Confirmed. All data inserted successfully. The architects are exposed."

But there's something in its tone. Something almost... satisfied.

Kira's suspicion deepens. But the operation is complete. The truth is out. No going back now.
