# Chapter 30: The Holdout

**Date**: July 1, 2115  
**Location**: CNT Capital  
**POV**: Chairman Viktor Kozlov (CNT)  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,500 words

## Summary

CNT refuses to join unified system. Chairman Kozlov addresses his nation:

"They've created tyranny of consensus. One truth. One system. One control. We remain free. We remain opposed. We are humanity's last defense against unified tyranny."

He harbors the eight fleeing architects. Gives them sanctuary. Uses them as advisors.

"You created the system," he tells them. "Help me resist it."

Voss and the other architects advise Kozlov. They're not in control anymore. But they're useful. They understand the unified system's weaknesses.

CNT militarizes. Threatens borders. Becomes the enemy the unified world didn't want but now has.

Kozlov broadcasts: "You united against the architects. Now you're united against us. The cycle continues. They were right: humans need enemies. We'll be that enemy. Because someone must resist. Someone must remain free."

The unified world faces dilemma: invade CNT and prove the architects right (humans need conflict)? Or coexist and prove humans can choose peace?

Marcus watches Kozlov's broadcast. Realizes: this is the final test. The architects predicted this. Exposure would create new enemies. New conflicts. The cycle would continue.

Can humanity break the cycle? Or will the architects be proven right?
