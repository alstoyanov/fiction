# Chapter 36: The Choice

**Date**: August 10, 2115  
**Location**: Unified Council Meeting  
**POV**: Dmitri Volkov  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,200 words

## Summary

Dmitri proposes official policy: "Don't invade CNT. Contain them. Defend ourselves. But don't attack. Prove we can choose peace even with opposition."

Debate rages. Some want invasion. "Complete the unity. Eliminate the threat."

Others want containment. "Prove the cycle can break. Prove humans can coexist."

Dmitri argues: "My brother Alexei died fighting for freedom. Not for unity. Not for control. For the right to choose. If we invade CNT, we dishonor his sacrifice. We prove the architects right. We continue the cycle."

"But if we contain CNT—defend ourselves but don't attack—we prove humans can choose peace. Can coexist with opposition. Can break the cycle."

Elena supports him: "I've fought my whole life. I know war. I know its cost. This is the first time in history we can choose not to fight. Let's choose peace."

The council votes. Containment wins. Narrow margin. But it wins.

Official policy: Defend borders. Don't invade. Coexist with CNT. Prove the cycle can break.
