**Date**: August 1, 2115  
**Location**: CNT (Broadcast)  
**POV**: Dr. Helena Voss (in CNT)  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,200 words

## Summary

Voss broadcasts from CNT. Final message to the world.

"You think you've won? You've proven our point. You united against us. Now you're united against CNT. You need enemies. We just provided them."

"We didn't fail. We succeeded. You just changed the enemy. The cycle continues. Humans need conflict. Need opposition. Need enemies to unite against."

"CNT is your enemy now. You'll fight them. Maybe not today. Maybe not this year. But eventually. Because that's what humans do. We fight. We need to fight. It's in our nature."

"We gave you designed conflicts you could manage. You rejected that. Now you have real conflicts you can't control. CNT will grow. Will threaten. Will force you to invade. And when you do, you'll prove we were right all along."

"We were architects of peace. You're architects of chaos. Good luck. You'll need it."

The message is devastating. Because part of it rings true. They did unite against the architects. They are united against CNT. The cycle does seem to continue.

Marcus watches. Feels doubt. Are the architects right? Do humans need enemies?
