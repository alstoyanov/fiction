## Summary

Voss broadcasts from CNT. Final message to the world.

"You think you've won? You've proven our point. You united against us. Now you're united against CNT. You need enemies. We just provided them."

"We didn't fail. We succeeded. You just changed the enemy. The cycle continues. Humans need conflict. Need opposition. Need enemies to unite against."

"And here's what you're learning: the people who remember the Fracture Years? They're defending us. They're saying: 'The architects saved us. Don't destroy what keeps us safe.' Because they remember. They chose certainty over chaos. They chose us."

"The people who grew up hearing horror stories? They're afraid. They're saying: 'What if it goes back to the Before Times?' Because they were taught to fear freedom. They inherited our trauma."

"Only the youngest generation—those who never experienced the fear—only they want change. But they're outnumbered by those who remember, those who were taught to fear, those who can't imagine alternatives."

"You exposed us. But you can't erase 46 years of trauma. You can't undo three generations of fear. You can't replace certainty with uncertainty and expect gratitude."

"CNT is your enemy now. You'll fight them. Maybe not today. Maybe not this year. But eventually. Because that's what humans do. We fight. We need to fight. It's in our nature."

"We gave you designed conflicts you could manage. You rejected that. Now you have real conflicts you can't control. CNT will grow. Will threaten. Will force you to invade. And when you do, you'll prove we were right all along."

"We were architects of peace. You're architects of chaos. Good luck. You'll need it. And when the chaos returns, remember: we warned you. We tried to save you from yourselves."

The message is devastating. Because part of it rings true. They did unite against the architects. They are united against CNT. The cycle does seem to continue.

Marcus watches. Feels doubt. Are the architects right? Do humans need enemies?
