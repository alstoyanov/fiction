**Location**: SFW Capital  
**POV**: President Sarah Martinez (SFW)  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,200 words

## Summary

Marcus approaches SFW with evidence. President Martinez—elected after General Stone's death—is reformist, open to dialogue.

Marcus shows her the architects' files. Points to Victoria Stone—General Marcus Stone's sister. She was an architect. She orchestrated the invasion of Veridica.

"Your people died for their game," Marcus says.

Martinez is horrified. The war that killed 8,000 SFW soldiers was designed. Manipulated. Her predecessor was a puppet.

"Why are you telling me this?" she asks.

"Because we need allies. The architects control Histologic nations. But SFW is outside their system. You're free. Help us expose them."

Martinez agrees. SFW will provide military support, intelligence resources, and international legitimacy. In exchange, after the architects fall, SFW joins the unified factorepo system—voluntarily.

"We were enemies," Martinez says. "The architects made us enemies. Let's prove we can be allies."

First alliance formed. SFW and Histologic nations united against common enemy.
