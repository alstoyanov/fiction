**Date**: April 10, 2115  
**Location**: Dr. Tanaka's Office  
**POV**: Dr. Yuki Tanaka  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,200 words

## Summary

Dr. Tanaka confronts Director Maya Tanaka—not her sister, but her sister's superior. One of the architects.

"You've been controlling everything. Using your position to manipulate global infrastructure."

Maya doesn't deny it. "I did it to protect people. To prevent chaos. To save lives."

"By taking away their choice?"

"By giving them structure. Humans need structure, Yuki. You're a doctor. You know: sometimes patients need to be protected from their own decisions."

"Patients aren't children. Humanity isn't your patient."

"Isn't it? We're all sick, Yuki. Sick with tribalism, nationalism, ideology. We gave humanity the cure: certainty. Structure. Peace."

"You gave them slavery."

"We gave them survival."

Tanaka realizes: the architects genuinely believe they're healers. They see humanity as sick and themselves as doctors. That's why they can justify anything.

"I'm going to stop you," Tanaka says.

"I know," Maya replies. "And I'm sorry. Because when we're gone, the sickness returns. And millions will die. But you'll have your freedom. I hope it's worth it."
