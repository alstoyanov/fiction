# Chapter 13: The Military Preparation

**Date**: March 25, 2115  
**Location**: Military Command Center  
**POV**: General Yevgenia Sokolov  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,500 words (CRITICAL - Family Confrontation)

## Summary

Sokolov confronts her mother, Chancellor Viktoria Sokolov of Chronos. One of the architects.

"You used me. My entire career—you orchestrated it."

Her mother doesn't deny it. "I gave you opportunities. You earned your position."

"In a system you designed. For purposes you controlled."

"To protect you. To protect everyone."

"By enslaving us?"

Her mother sighs. "Yevgenia, you're a soldier. You understand: sometimes people need to be protected from themselves. That's what we did. We protected humanity from its own chaos."

"By lying to us. By manipulating us. By making us puppets."

"By giving you peace. Prosperity. Progress. Would you rather have another World War? Another Fracture?"

Sokolov realizes: her mother genuinely believes she's helping. That's what makes it tragic. The architects aren't monsters. They're parents who can't let their children grow up.

"I'm going to stop you," Sokolov says.

"I know," her mother replies. "And I'll try to stop you. Because I love you. Because I'm trying to protect you. Even from yourself."

They part as enemies. Mother and daughter. Architect and liberator.

Sokolov prepares military forces. When the architects meet, her troops will surround them. Capture them. No escape.
