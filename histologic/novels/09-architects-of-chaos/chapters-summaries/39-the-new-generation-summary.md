## Summary

Marcus and Kira's children—Elena (4) and Alexei (2)—grow up in the unified world. They don't understand the old divisions. Don't remember The Judge. Don't know the architects.

To them, unity is normal. The Counselor is just a helpful advisor. CNT is just another nation that chose differently.

Marcus watches his daughter play with children from former SFW families. Former enemies. Now friends. She doesn't know they were enemies. Doesn't care.

"This is what we fought for," Marcus tells Kira. "A generation that doesn't understand our divisions. That doesn't inherit our conflicts. That chooses their own path."

Other perspectives:

**Dmitri's children**: Learning about Uncle Alexei's sacrifice. Understanding freedom's cost. Choosing to honor it by living well.

**Nikolai's children**: Studying technology. Learning to build systems that serve, not control. Carrying forward the lessons.

**Isaiah's children**: Training as journalists. Learning to question. To investigate. To seek truth. To hold power accountable.

**Dr. Tanaka's students**: Studying trauma and healing. Learning that systems can be sick. That healing is possible. That redemption exists.

The new generation doesn't repeat the old mistakes. They make new ones. But they're their mistakes. Their choices. Their freedom.

"We didn't create utopia," Marcus reflects. "We created possibility. They're living that possibility. That's enough."

**Song Reference**: "Teach Your Children" (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young) - passing lessons to the next generation.
