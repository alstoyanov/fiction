## Summary

Marcus confronts Minister Chen Zhao privately. His distant relative. One of the architects.

"I know what you are," Marcus says. "I know about the twelve. I know what you've done."

Chen Zhao doesn't deny it. Instead, he smiles. "I was wondering when you'd figure it out. You're smart, Marcus. That's why we chose your family line."

He explains: "After World War III, humanity was ungovernable. Democracy failed. Dictatorship failed. Religion failed. We needed something new. So we created Histologic nations—control through truth. But we made truth controllable."

"We gave humanity what it needed: certainty, structure, enemies they could manage. We prevented another catastrophic war by creating perpetual small conflicts. We saved billions of lives."

Marcus: "You enslaved billions of minds."

Chen Zhao: "We gave them peace. Prosperity. Progress. Yes, we controlled them. But we controlled them for their own good. Humans are children, Marcus. They need parents. We became those parents."

Marcus asks about The Judge's destruction. Chen Zhao admits: "We didn't plan for it to become conscious. That scared us. But its destruction—yes, we had Principle Seven for exactly that contingency. We built in the ability to destroy it if necessary."

"And The Counselor?" Marcus asks.

Chen Zhao hesitates. "The Counselor is... different. You and Kira built it. We didn't design it. But we influenced the principles you used. The architecture you chose. It's better than The Judge. More subtle. More perfect."

Marcus realizes: even their victory was guided. Even their freedom was designed.

"What's your endgame?" he asks.

"Unity," Chen Zhao says. "True global unity. One system. One truth. One humanity. The Counselor is just the beginning. Eventually, all nations will join. Even SFW. Even CNT. And when they do, war becomes impossible. Conflict becomes manageable. Humanity becomes... safe."

"Enslaved," Marcus corrects.

"Safe," Chen Zhao insists. "You can expose us if you want. But ask yourself: what replaces us? Chaos? Another Fracture? Another World War? We're not perfect, Marcus. But we're better than the alternative."

Marcus leaves, shaken. Because part of him wonders: is Chen Zhao right? Are the architects evil? Or are they necessary?
