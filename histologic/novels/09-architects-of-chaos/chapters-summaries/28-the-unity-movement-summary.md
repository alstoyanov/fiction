## Summary

President Martinez proposes unity. SFW joining Histologic system voluntarily.

"We were all manipulated. Let's unite against manipulation. One factorepo. Shared history. Agreed-upon truth."

Historic summit. All nations except CNT attend.

Debates about implementation. How to merge different systems? How to resolve conflicts? How to ensure no new architects emerge?

The Counselor proposes solution: "I can maintain unified system. But humans must judge conflicts. I advise. You decide. Partnership, not control."

Nations agree. Historic moment. Unity through choice, not force.

But CNT refuses. Harbors the fleeing architects. Becomes sole opposition.
