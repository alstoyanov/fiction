**Location**: Global Tribunal  
**POV**: Marcus Chen  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,200 words

## Summary

Captured architects put on trial. Global tribunal. Broadcast worldwide.

Wei Zhang testifies. Provides evidence. Explains the system.

Some architects defiant: "We saved you from yourselves."
Others repentant: "We thought we were helping."

The tribunal convicts them. But sentences are measured: imprisonment, not execution. Rehabilitation, not revenge.

"We're better than they are," Marcus testifies. "They controlled through fear. We choose justice through mercy."

But the question haunts everyone: who is the 13th architect? DV-12? The one who controlled the controllers?

Wei Zhang doesn't know. No one knows. The 13th architect remains hidden.
