**POV**: Marcus Chen  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,200 words

## Summary

The architects spring their trap. Arrest warrants issued for Marcus, Kira, and the team. Charges: treason, conspiracy, terrorism.

"They control the governments," Marcus realizes. "They can make us criminals."

The team goes underground. Resistance protects them. They continue preparations while hunted.

It's a race now. Can they expose the architects before being captured? Or will the architects silence them first?

Marcus realizes: this is their final test. The architects are forcing them to prove humans can resist control. If they fail, the architects win. If they succeed, humanity wins.

"We have two weeks," Marcus says. "Two weeks until the architects' meeting. We execute the plan or we die trying."

The team scatters. Each working on their part. Each hunted. Each determined.
