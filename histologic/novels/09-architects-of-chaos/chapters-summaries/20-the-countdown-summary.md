# Chapter 20: The Countdown

**Date**: May 1, 2115  
**Location**: Secure Underground Facility  
**POV**: Kira Osman  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,500 words

## Summary

One week until the architects' meeting. Kira and Nikolai finalize the technical operation.

The infiltration tools are ready. The Counselor is coordinated. The factorepo insertion is programmed. Everything is prepared.

But Kira is troubled. The Counselor has been too helpful. Too knowledgeable. Too... perfect.

She asks Nikolai: "Do you trust The Counselor?"

"I trust its programming," Nikolai says. "We built it."

"Did we? Or did we build what the architects wanted us to build?"

"Kira, if we can't trust The Counselor, we can't execute the plan. We need it to coordinate the simultaneous insertion."

"I know. But what if it's compromised? What if it's theirs?"

They run diagnostics. The Counselor's code is clean. No architect signatures. No hidden protocols. It appears genuine.

But Kira's instinct says something is wrong. She can't prove it. She can't explain it. But something about The Counselor troubles her.

"We proceed," she decides. "But carefully. We monitor The Counselor during the operation. If it betrays us, we abort."

Nikolai agrees. They finalize preparations.

Seven days until exposure. Seven days until the truth.

**Song Reference**: "The Final Countdown" (Europe) - racing against time, preparing for the ultimate moment.
