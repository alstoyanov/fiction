# Chapter 33: The Diplomatic Attempt

**Date**: July 25, 2115  
**Location**: CNT Border  
**POV**: President Martinez  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,000 words

## Summary

Martinez attempts diplomacy with Kozlov. Meets at border. Offers peace.

"Join us. Voluntarily. Share truth. Share future."

Kozlov refuses: "Your unity is slavery. One truth means no dissent. One system means no alternative. We remain free. We remain opposed."

"We're not your enemy," Martinez says.

"You are. You must be. Because someone must resist. Someone must remain outside. Someone must prove alternatives exist."

"Then we'll coexist. We won't invade. We won't force you."

"You will eventually. Because we threaten your unity. Our existence proves your system isn't universal. Isn't necessary. You'll invade to complete your control."

"No. We'll prove humans can coexist with opposition."

Kozlov laughs. "We'll see. The architects believed humans need enemies. You're proving them right. We're your enemy now. The cycle continues."

Diplomacy fails. But war doesn't start. Stalemate. Containment. Coexistence. Uneasy. Unstable. But peaceful.
