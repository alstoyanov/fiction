# Chapter 31: The Peace Treaty

**Date**: July 15, 2115  
**Location**: Historic Summit  
**POV**: Marcus Chen  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,200 words

## Summary

Historic treaty signed. All nations except CNT unified. Shared factorepo. Shared truth. Shared future.

Marcus signs for Veridica. Martinez for SFW. Representatives from all nations.

"For the first time in history, most of humanity is united," Marcus says. "Not through conquest. Through choice."

But CNT's absence haunts the celebration. One nation opposed. Harboring architects. Threatening war.

Pressure builds to invade. Eliminate the threat. Complete the unity.

Marcus resists: "If we invade, we prove the architects right. We prove humans need conflict. We prove the cycle continues."

But CNT is militarizing. Threatening. Becoming more dangerous daily.

The treaty is signed. But peace is incomplete. And everyone knows it.
