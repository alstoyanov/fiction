## Summary

Marcus assembles the team: Kira, Dmitri, Nikolai, Elena, Isaiah, General Sokolov, Dr. Tanaka. He shares Dr. Singh's evidence and his own findings.

They identify all twelve architects:

1. **Dr. Helena Voss** (78) - The Visionary, created Histologic theory
2. **Dr. Yuri Petrov** (70) - The Scientist, built The Judge's vulnerabilities
3. **Chairman Liu Wei** (62) - The Financier, controls global economy
4. **Ambassador Sarah Okonkwo** (55) - The Diplomat, Isaiah's aunt
5. **Professor Adrian Volkov** (deceased) - The Historian, Volkov uncle
6. **Director Maya Tanaka** (52) - The Technologist, Dr. Tanaka's sister's superior
7. **Cardinal Thomas Kovač** (73) - The Ideologue, Julian Kovač's uncle (Novel 7)
8. **Colonel James Morrison** (45) - The Operative, covert operations
9. **Chancellor Viktoria Sokolov** (60) - The Administrator, General Sokolov's mother
10. **Dr. Wei Zhang** (58) - The Psychologist, Thomas Wei's father (Novel 5)
11. **Minister Chen Zhao** (65) - The Politician, Marcus's distant relative
12. **DV-12** (identity still unknown) - The 13th Architect

Everyone in the room has a family connection to the architects. It's not coincidence—it's design. The architects targeted specific families, guided specific careers, shaped specific lives.

General Sokolov is devastated learning her mother is an architect. Dr. Tanaka is horrified about her sister's superior. Isaiah is angry about his aunt. Marcus is disturbed by his relative.

"They made us," Elena Volkov says. "Not just influenced us. Made us. Our careers, our skills, our positions—all designed to serve their purposes."

The team debates: expose them now or wait for the meeting in three months?

Marcus argues for waiting: "If we expose them now, they'll scatter. We need to catch them all at once. At their meeting. With undeniable proof."

They agree. Three months to prepare. Then they strike.

**Key Discovery**: All twelve architects identified. Everyone connected. Meeting in three months provides target.
