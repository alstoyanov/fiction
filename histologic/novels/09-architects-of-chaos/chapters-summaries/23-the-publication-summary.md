## Summary

Isaiah's exposé publishes globally. "The Architects of Chaos" goes viral instantly. Every news outlet. Every language. Unstoppable.

His aunt contacts him: "You've destroyed everything we built."

"I've freed everyone you enslaved," he replies.

The story includes Dr. Singh's testimony (she's still alive, barely). Interviews with the team. Complete evidence.

The world knows. The architects are exposed. No hiding. No denying.
