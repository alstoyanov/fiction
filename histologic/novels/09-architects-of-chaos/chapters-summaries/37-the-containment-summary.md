# Chapter 37: The Containment

**Date**: August 15-30, 2115  
**Location**: CNT Border  
**POV**: General Sokolov  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,000 words

## Summary

Sokolov implements containment. Defensive posture. Strong borders. No aggression.

CNT tests them. Raids. Provocations. Trying to force invasion.

Unified forces defend. But don't retaliate. Don't invade. Hold the line.

It's difficult. Soldiers want revenge. Want to strike back. Sokolov holds them: "We defend. We don't attack. That's the difference. That's how we break the cycle."

Months pass. CNT realizes: they won't invade. Won't force unity. Will coexist.

Tensions remain. But war doesn't start. Containment holds. The cycle bends. Maybe breaks.

"We're doing it," Sokolov reports. "We're coexisting with opposition. It's not perfect. But it's working."
