# Chapter 3: The Family Connection

**Date**: January 25, 2115  
**Location**: Dmitri Volkov's Home  
**POV**: Dmitri Volkov  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,200 words

## Summary

Marcus visits Dmitri privately. Shows him the evidence. Points to one signature: AV-05 - Adrian Volkov.

"Your uncle. Your father's brother. He was one of them."

Dmitri is stunned. Uncle Adrian was a historian, a professor. Dmitri knew him as a child. He died ten years ago—supposedly of natural causes.

Marcus shows more evidence: Adrian Volkov wasn't just a contributor. He designed the historical methodology that all Histologic nations use. He determined what counted as "fact" and what didn't. He shaped how history was recorded, verified, preserved.

"He controlled the past," Marcus says. "And whoever controls the past controls the future."

Dmitri thinks about his family. His parents—both dead. His brother Alexei—dead in the war. His siblings Nikolai and Elena—still alive, still fighting. Were they targeted? Was their family chosen deliberately?

Marcus shows him more: The Volkov family has been involved in every major crisis. Dmitri's military career. Elena's resistance work. Nikolai's technical expertise. Alexei's sacrifice. All of it served the architects' purposes.

"We weren't just participants," Marcus says. "We were instruments."

Dmitri feels rage building. His brother died in a war that might have been designed. He's spent five years honoring that sacrifice. But what if it was all manipulation?

He makes a decision: "I'm in. Whatever you need. We find these architects. We expose them. We end this."

Marcus nods. "I need you to investigate the military connections. If the architects controlled everything, they controlled the wars. Find out how."

Dmitri agrees. He'll use his position as Defense Minister to access classified records. Find the patterns. Trace the manipulation.

**Key Discovery**: The Volkov family was deliberately involved in every crisis. Adrian Volkov shaped historical methodology itself.
