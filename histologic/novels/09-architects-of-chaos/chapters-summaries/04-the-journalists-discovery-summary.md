## Summary

Isaiah Okonkwo has been investigating international conflicts for a new book. He notices patterns: the same shadow figures appearing in backgrounds of major events. Advisors who aren't officially recorded. Diplomats with no clear credentials. Financiers with untraceable funds.

He cross-references with his aunt's career: Ambassador Sarah Okonkwo. She's been involved in every major international negotiation for thirty years. Always in the background. Always influential. Never in the spotlight.

He arranges a meeting with her. Casual. Family dinner. But he asks pointed questions.

She's evasive at first. Then, when he presses, she becomes defensive. Finally, she says something that chills him: "Isaiah, some things are better left uninvestigated. For your own safety."

It's a threat. Subtle, but clear. His own aunt is threatening him.

He digs deeper. Finds connections between his aunt and eleven other figures. They meet regularly. No official record. No public acknowledgment. But they meet. And after they meet, things happen. Wars start. Wars end. Governments change. Policies shift.

He realizes: they're not just influential. They're controlling. They're the architects Marcus suspected.

He contacts Marcus. Shares his findings. Confirms the conspiracy is real and active.

**Key Discovery**: The architects meet regularly and actively control global events. Isaiah's aunt is one of them.
