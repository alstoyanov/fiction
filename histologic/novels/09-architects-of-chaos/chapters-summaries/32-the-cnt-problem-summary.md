# Chapter 32: The CNT Problem

**Date**: July 20, 2115  
**Location**: Military Command  
**POV**: General Sokolov  
**Word Count Target**: ~1,200 words

## Summary

CNT militarizing rapidly. Threatening borders. Conducting raids. Harboring architects who advise them.

Military pressure on Sokolov: "We need to invade. Eliminate the threat. Complete the unity."

Sokolov resists: "If we invade, we become what we fought against. We become the architects—controlling through force."

But CNT is becoming dangerous. Real threat. Not designed conflict. Actual enemy.

"They're becoming exactly what the architects wanted," Sokolov realizes. "The enemy that justifies our unity. The threat that validates our control."

She proposes containment: "We defend. We don't attack. We prove we can coexist with opposition. We break the cycle."

But how long can containment last? How long before CNT forces their hand?
